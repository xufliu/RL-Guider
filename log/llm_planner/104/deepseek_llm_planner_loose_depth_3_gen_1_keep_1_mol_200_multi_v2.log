AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the molecule `C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the original.

2. **Analysis of Previous Attempts**: 
   - In the previous attempt, the modification involved changing the `[NH2+]` group to `[NH]`, `[N]`, `[NH2]`, `[N+]`, and `[NH2+]`. However, this led to an **increase** in QED (from 0.8905721662621562 to 0.91112117152639), which is counter to the goal.
   - Therefore, simply altering the charge or protonation state of the amine group is not effective in decreasing QED.

3. **Strategy**:
   - To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that typically reduce drug-likeness, such as adding bulky groups, increasing molecular weight, or introducing polar or charged groups.
   - The modification should be conservative to maintain structural similarity.

4. **Proposed Modification**:
   - Replace the `[NH2+]` group with a hydroxyl group. This introduces a polar functional group that can reduce drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the [NH2+] group with a hydroxyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the molecule `C#CCOc1cc(F)ccc1NC(=O)C(=O)NCCc1ccncc1C` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the original molecule.

2. **Previous Experience:** From the previous suggestions, it was observed that modifications to the pyridine ring (e.g., replacing a hydrogen with different groups) did not significantly decrease the QED. Therefore, we need to consider modifications elsewhere in the molecule.

3. **Guidelines:** The modification should not repeat previous suggestions, should be explicit about the functional group or atom changes, and should maintain structural similarity.

4. **Target Area:** The carbonyl groups (`C(=O)C(=O)`) are potential targets for modification because they are important for drug-likeness. Modifying these groups can significantly impact the QED.

5. **Suggested Modification:** Replace one of the carbonyl groups with a less drug-like functional group, such as a methylene group, to decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the carbonyl groups (C=O) in the amide linkage with a methylene group (CH2)."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the molecule `CCC[NH2+]Cc1ncoc1-c1c(F)cccc1F` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the original.

2. **Previous Experience**: In previous attempts, halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br, I) and nitro groups (NO₂) were added or replaced, which increased the QED instead of decreasing it. This suggests that adding or replacing atoms with highly polar or electron-withdrawing groups may not be the correct strategy to decrease QED.

3. **QED Considerations**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we need to make the molecule less "drug-like," which could involve:
   - Increasing molecular weight.
   - Increasing logP (more lipophilic).
   - Increasing the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.
   - Increasing polar surface area.

4. **Similarity Consideration**: The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the original, so we should avoid making drastic changes to the core structure.

5. **Action Space**: Based on the guidelines, we can consider adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups.

### Suggested Modification Strategy:
- **Add a Hydroxyl Group**: Adding a hydroxyl group (OH) to the aromatic ring can increase polar surface area and introduce a hydrogen bond donor, which could decrease QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring at the meta position relative to the fluorine atom."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Objective**: We need to modify the molecule to make it less like a drug by decreasing its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0. The modified molecule should still be similar to the original molecule.

2. **Previous Attempts**: 
   - Replacing the sulfur atom with an oxygen atom in the thioether group increased the QED (0.6727020059041009), which is contrary to our goal.
   - Other modifications kept the QED close to the original (0.6009762687271423).

3. **Learning**:
   - Replacing the sulfur atom with an oxygen atom made the molecule more drug-like, so we should avoid this type of modification.
   - To decrease QED, we should consider adding functional groups that are typically less favorable in drug-like molecules or reducing the complexity of the molecule.

4. **Suggested Action**:
   - **Adding a Nitro Group (NO2)**: Nitro groups are generally unfavorable in drug-like molecules due to their potential toxicity and metabolic instability. Adding a nitro group to the aromatic ring should decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

5. **Reasoning**:
   - The nitro group is less favorable in drug-like molecules, so adding it should decrease the QED.
   - The modification maintains the core structure of the molecule, ensuring similarity to the original molecule.

**final_suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the aromatic ring at position 4 of the phenyl ring attached to the sulfur atom."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: Modify the molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Previous Experience**: In the previous attempt, modifications were made to the thiophene ring (c3cccs3) by replacing it with different aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, pyridine, etc.), but QED increased in one case (0.8616827034300242 for CCC[C@H]1CCc2c(sc(NC(=O)c3ccccc3)c2C(N)=O)C1). This suggests that altering the aromatic ring alone may not be sufficient to decrease QED.
3. **New Strategy**: To decrease QED, we should consider modifying parts of the molecule that contribute to drug-likeness, such as the amide group (NC(=O)), the thioether linkage (sc), or the ketone group (C(N)=O). These functional groups are often associated with drug-like properties.
4. **Similarity**: To maintain similarity, we will make conservative changes, such as replacing the amide group with a less drug-like functional group or altering the thioether linkage.
5. **Action Space**: We will focus on replacing functional groups rather than adding or deleting atoms to minimize drastic changes.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with an ester group (COO)."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity. Based on the previous suggestions, we can infer that modifying the aromatic ring or the functional groups attached to it could be a viable strategy. However, the previous modifications (e.g., replacing fluorine with chlorine, bromine, iodine, or hydroxyl) did not result in a significant decrease in QED. 

To further decrease QED, we could consider adding a bulky or polar group that might disrupt the drug-like properties of the molecule. For example, adding a carboxyl group or a sulfonyl group could increase the molecule's hydrophilicity and decrease its QED. Additionally, we should ensure that the modification does not drastically alter the overall structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

After considering these factors, a reasonable suggestion would be to replace the fluorine atom with a carboxyl group, as this would introduce a polar and bulky group that could decrease the QED while maintaining some similarity to the original structure.

**final_suggestion**: ["Replace the fluorine atom on the benzene ring with a carboxyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal Analysis**:  
   The task is to modify the molecule `CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nnc1-c1cccs1` to make it **less like a drug** and **decrease its QED** by at least 0. The modified molecule should still be **similar** to the original molecule.

2. **Previous Experience**:  
   In the previous attempt, modifications to the aromatic ring (e.g., replacing `c1cccs1` with `c1ccccc1`, `c1ccccn1`, etc.) were made. However, these changes did not significantly decrease the QED (e.g., the QED of `CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nnc1-c1ccccc1` is **0.8127**, which is higher than the original QED of **0.8075**). This suggests that modifications to the aromatic ring may not be effective in reducing QED.

3. **Action Space**:  
   To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are less drug-like, such as **bulky groups**, **polar groups**, or **stereochemical complexity**. However, we must also ensure that the molecule remains similar to the original.

4. **Target Substructure**:  
   Instead of modifying the aromatic ring, we can target the **amide group** (`NC(=O)`) or the **thioether group** (`CSC`). These are more likely to influence QED when modified.

5. **Suggestion**:  
   Replace the **amide group** (`NC(=O)`) with a **sulfonamide group** (`NS(=O)(=O)`). Sulfonamides are bulkier and more polar, which should reduce the drug-likeness and decrease QED.

6. **Similarity Consideration**:  
   The rest of the molecule remains unchanged, ensuring structural similarity.

---

**Final Suggestion**:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a sulfonamide group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let’s break down the problem step-by-step:

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule `CC(C)[NH2+]Cc1cncc(N2Cc3ccccc3C2)n1` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0, while keeping the molecule similar to the original.
2. **QED Threshold**: The QED of the root molecule is **0.913968265627823**, and we need to decrease it by at least 0.
3. **Previous Attempts**: In the previous suggestions, modifications were made to the aromatic ring system (e.g., adding or replacing methyl groups on the benzene ring). However, the QED of the first candidate increased to **0.9205710679511618**, which is the opposite of the goal.
4. **Action Space**: We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups.
5. **Constraints**: 
   - Avoid repeating previous suggestions.
   - Ensure modifications maintain structural similarity.
   - Use full names of atoms or functional groups (no abbreviations).

### Strategy:
To decrease QED, we should introduce features that are less drug-like, such as:
- Increasing molecular weight or complexity.
- Introducing non-polar or bulky groups.
- Reducing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.

Given that previous modifications to the benzene ring failed to decrease QED, we should consider modifying other parts of the molecule, such as:
- The primary amine group (`[NH2+]`).
- The pyridine ring (`c1cnccn1`).
- The aliphatic chain (`CC(C)`).

### Final Suggestion:
Replace the positively charged primary amine group with a more complex and less polar functional group, such as a tertiary amine, to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the positively charged primary amine group attached to the carbon chain with a tertiary amine group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule C[NH2+][C@](C)(C(=O)[O-])c1cccc(Cl)c1 less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0, we need to consider modifications that disrupt desirable drug-like properties. From the previous suggestions, replacing the chlorine atom with other halogens (Br, I, F) or a nitro group (NO2) did not decrease the QED, as evidenced by the QED of the bromine-substituted molecule (0.8021705368323653), which is higher than the root molecule’s QED (0.7361276360299035).

To further reduce QED, we should consider modifications that introduce steric hindrance, reduce solubility, or disrupt the molecular symmetry. One effective approach could be to introduce a bulkier or more hydrophobic group in place of the chlorine atom, which would likely reduce QED by making the molecule less drug-like.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Learn from Previous Experience**: Replacing the chlorine atom with other halogens or a nitro group increased QED, so we need a different approach.
2. **Modification Strategy**: Introduce a bulkier or more hydrophobic group (e.g., a tert-butyl group or a phenyl ring) to increase steric hindrance or decrease solubility.
3. **Similarity Consideration**: The modification should preserve the overall structure of the molecule, focusing on the aromatic ring and keeping the rest of the molecule intact.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the chlorine atom with a tert-butyl group on the aromatic ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal**: To make the molecule less like a drug and decrease the QED by at least 0. The current best molecule is `C[NH2+][C@](C)(C(=O)[O-])c1cccc(Cl)c1`, with a QED of 0.7361276360299035. The previous attempt to replace the chlorine atom with a tert-butyl group increased the QED to 0.8100944244098168, which is not desirable.

2. **Guidelines**:
   - The modification should decrease QED by at least 0.
   - The modified molecule should be similar to the input molecule.
   - Do not repeat previous suggestions (e.g., replacing with tert-butyl group).
   - Use full names of atoms or functional groups, not abbreviations.
   - Each suggestion should be a sentence of modification instruction.

3. **Possible Actions**:
   - **Add**: Adding bulky or polar groups can decrease QED by making the molecule less drug-like.
   - **Replace**: Replacing the chlorine atom with a less drug-like group could decrease QED.
   - **Delete**: Removing a functional group might decrease QED but could also reduce similarity.

4. **Consideration of Similarity**: The modification should retain the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.

5. **Final Decision**: Replace the chlorine atom with a less drug-like group that decreases QED. A good candidate is a nitro group, which is polar and bulky, likely decreasing QED while maintaining similarity.

**final_suggestion**:
```python
["Replace the chlorine atom on the aromatic ring with a nitro group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the molecule `CC(C)C[C@@H]([NH3+])c1ccc(Cl)cc1` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modifications should maintain structural similarity to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Experience**: In the previous attempt, modifications like adding a methyl group (`C`) or a fluorine atom (`F`) to the aromatic ring did not sufficiently decrease the QED. In fact, adding a methyl group increased the QED to 0.798, which is higher than the original QED of 0.774.

3. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-likeness, such as adding bulky or polar groups, or removing functional groups that contribute to drug-like properties. However, we must also ensure the molecule remains structurally similar to the original.

4. **Action Selection**: Based on the previous experience, adding small substituents like methyl or fluorine is not effective. Instead, we should consider adding a more bulky or polar group to the aromatic ring or modifying the side chain.

5. **Modification**: To decrease QED, we will add a nitro group (`NO2`) to the aromatic ring. Nitro groups are polar and bulky, which can reduce drug-likeness. Additionally, nitro groups are known to decrease QED values.

6. **Similarity Consideration**: Adding a nitro group to the aromatic ring maintains the core structure of the molecule while introducing a significant change that should decrease QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the aromatic ring at the para position relative to the chlorine atom."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task and reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease the QED by at least 0 compared to the root molecule (QED: 0.648). The modified molecule should retain structural similarity to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Experience**: In the previous attempt, modifying the hydroxyl group (to neutral) and changing functional groups (e.g., cyano group to alkyl chain) did not significantly decrease the QED (< 0.648). This suggests that more drastic changes might be necessary.

3. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace atoms/functional groups while maintaining structural similarity.

4. **Key Insights**:
   - The molecule contains a charged nitrogen (NH+), which could be modified to reduce drug-likeness.
   - The presence of a cyano group (C#N) could be altered to decrease the QED.
   - The ester linkage (CCO) could be disrupted to reduce drug-like properties.

5. **Strategy**: Replace the charged nitrogen (NH+) with a neutral group and modify the cyano group to a bulkier or less polar functional group.

6. **Reasoning**: Removing the charge and introducing bulkier groups should reduce drug-likeness and QED while maintaining structural similarity.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the positively charged nitrogen (NH+) with a neutral methyl group and replace the cyano group (C#N) with a bulkier tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Task**: The goal is to modify the molecule `CCO[C@H]1C[C@@H]([O-])C12CC[NH+](CCC(=O)N(C)CCC#N)CC2` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should retain structural similarity to the original.

2. **Previous Attempts**:
   - The previous modification involved replacing the positively charged nitrogen with a neutral methyl group and the cyano group with a tert-butyl group. However, this resulted in a QED increase (0.6603936253100663) compared to the original molecule (0.6482962480799032).

3. **Learning from Past Experience**:
   - The tert-butyl group is bulky and often increases lipophilicity, which can increase QED. Instead of increasing bulkiness, we should consider reducing molecular complexity or introducing polar groups that decrease drug-likeness.

4. **Strategy**:
   - **Focus on Functional Groups**: Replace the cyano group with a less drug-like functional group, such as a hydroxyl group or carboxylic acid, which are more polar and can decrease QED.
   - **Avoid Increasing Lipophilicity**: Avoid adding bulky groups like tert-butyl, as they can inadvertently increase QED.

5. **Action Space**:
   - Replace the cyano group with a hydroxyl group. This increases polarity and reduces drug-likeness.

6. **Similarity Consideration**:
   - The hydroxyl group is small and does not significantly alter the overall structure, maintaining similarity to the original molecule.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the cyano group in the molecule with a hydroxyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain similar to the original.

2. **Previous Attempts:** The previous suggestions involved changes in stereochemistry or adding aromatic rings, but these did not achieve a significant decrease in QED. The QED remained unchanged in the previous attempt.

3. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. This can be achieved by adding bulky or polar groups, removing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, or increasing hydrophobicity.

4. **Similarity Consideration:** The modification should preserve the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity. We should focus on peripheral modifications rather than altering the core scaffold.

5. **Proposed Modification:** Adding a large hydrophobic group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) to the molecule could decrease its drug-likeness and QED while maintaining structural similarity.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a tert-butyl group to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The objective is to modify the molecule **CC[C@H](C)C(=O)[C@@H](C)c1ccncc1** to decrease its QED by at least 0 while maintaining similarity to the original structure. The current QED of the root molecule is 0.732, and the previous modification (adding a tert-butyl group) increased the QED to 0.790, which is not desired.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The molecule should remain similar to the original structure.
   - The QED must decrease by at least 0.
   - Avoid repeating previous modifications (e.g., adding a tert-butyl group).
   - Use explicit descriptions of atoms or functional groups, not abbreviations.

3. **Possible Strategies**:
   - **Deleting polar or hydrogen-bonding groups**: Removing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl) can decrease the QED by reducing drug-likeness.
   - **Adding bulky non-polar groups**: Introducing bulky non-polar groups can decrease QED by reducing solubility or increasing molecular weight.
   - **Replacing polar groups with non-polar groups**: For example, replacing a hydroxyl group with a methyl group can decrease drug-likeness.

4. **Chosen Strategy**: Replace the carbonyl group with a less polar functional group, such as a methylene group. This modification maintains molecular similarity while reducing drug-likeness.

5. **Modification Instruction**: Replace the carbonyl group adjacent to the chiral carbon with a methylene group.

6. **Outcome**: This change reduces the polarity of the molecule and lowers its QED.

---

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group adjacent to the chiral carbon with a methylene group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Alright, I'm trying to tackle this problem of modifying the given molecule to make it less drug-like by decreasing its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while keeping the overall structure similar. Here's how I'm approaching it:

**Understanding the Objective:**
- **Original Molecule SMILES:** `CCc1ccc([C@@H](COC)NC(=O)N[C@H]2CCCC[C@@H]2C)o1`
- **Original QED:** 0.8462478798281003
- **Goal:** Decrease the QED by at least 0 and make the molecule less drug-like, while maintaining structural similarity.

**Analyzing the Molecule:**
The given molecule is fairly complex, with multiple functional groups:
1. An ethyl group (`CC`)
2. A benzene ring with a substituted position (`c1ccc...o1`)
3. A stereocenter with a carbon attached to a methoxy group (`[C@@H](COC)`)
4. A urea linkage (`NC(=O)N`)
5. A cyclohexane ring with a stereocenter (`[C@H]2CCCC[C@@H]2C`)

**Considering QED Factors:**
QED is influenced by several molecular properties, including molecular weight, solubility, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, and the number of rotatable bonds. To decrease QED, I might want to:
- Increase molecular weight
- Make the molecule less soluble
- Increase the number of rotatable bonds
- Alter the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors

**Previous Attempts:**
Looking at the previous suggestions, there were repeats of the same molecule with minor chirality changes, which didn't alter the QED. To avoid this, I need to make more impactful changes without drastically altering the core structure.

**Potential Modifications:**
1. **Adding a Bulky Group:** Inserting a larger, less polar group could increase molecular weight and decrease solubility.
2. **Introducing Steric Hindrance:** Adding groups that increase the number of rotatable bonds or introduce steric clashes.
3. **Changing Functional Groups:** Modifying existing functional groups to less drug-like variants.

**Top Suggestion:**
Considering similarity and the need to significantly impact QED, I propose:
- **Adding a phenyl group to the existing ethyl group to increase the molecular weight and the complexity without dramatically altering the core structure.**

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a phenyl group to the ethyl group to increase molecular weight and complexity."]
```

This modification should make the molecule bulkier and less drug-like, thereby decreasing its QED while keeping the structure similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the molecule `Cc1ccccc1[C@@H]1NC(=[NH2+])Nc2nc3ccccc3n21` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should still be similar to the original structure.

2. **Previous Experience**: From the previous suggestions, it was observed that replacing the `=[NH2+]` group with other groups (e.g., `=O`, `=S`, `=NH`, etc.) led to an increase in QED, which is contrary to the desired outcome. Therefore, we need to explore other modifications that could potentially decrease the QED.

3. **Action Space**: We can consider adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups. Since adding or deleting atoms could significantly alter the structure, we should focus on replacing functional groups while maintaining structural similarity.

4. **Considerations for Similarity**: To maintain similarity, the replacement should involve a small, localized change to the molecule, avoiding major structural alterations.

5. **Potential Strategy**: Replace the `=[NH2+]` group with a bulkier or less polar group that could disrupt the drug-like properties and decrease the QED. One option is to replace it with a `methyl group`, which is less polar and could reduce the molecule's drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the =[NH2+] group with a methyl group while keeping the rest of the structure unchanged."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal Analysis:** The task is to modify the molecule `Cc1ccccc1[C@@H]1NC(=[NH2+])Nc2nc3ccccc3n21` to make it less like a drug by decreasing its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should retain structural similarity to the original.

2. **Previous Attempts:** Previous modifications focused on replacing the `=[NH2+]` group, but the QED of the resulting molecule increased, which is contrary to the goal. This suggests that simply replacing the `=[NH2+]` group with other functional groups may not be effective.

3. **Chemical Considerations:** To decrease QED, we need to introduce changes that reduce drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular weight, introducing bulky groups, or adding polar groups that decrease permeability.

4. **Similarity Constraints:** The modification should retain the core structure of the molecule, so changes should be localized to specific functional groups rather than altering the entire framework.

5. **Action Space:** The available actions are to add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group. Based on previous attempts, replacing the `=[NH2+]` group was not successful, so we should explore other modifications.

6. **Suggested Modification:** Introduce a bulky, polar group to the molecule to decrease QED while retaining core structure. A suitable modification would be to replace the `=[NH2+]` group with a sulfonamide group, which is bulkier and more polar, thus likely to decrease QED.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the =[NH2+] group with a sulfonamide group while keeping the rest of the structure unchanged."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the given molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should still be similar to the original molecule.

2. **Previous Experience**: In the previous attempt, the fluorine atom was replaced with other halogens (Cl, Br, I), a nitro group (NO2), and an amino group (N). These modifications either did not decrease the QED or increased it slightly, as seen with the Cl substitution (QED increased to 0.8575953352822491).

3. **Action Space**: The available actions include adding, deleting, or replacing an atom or functional group. Given the previous results, replacing the fluorine atom with larger or more complex groups may not be effective in decreasing QED.

4. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce less drug-like properties. One approach could be to disrupt the aromatic system or introduce a less favorable functional group in the phenyl ring. However, we must maintain similarity, so the modification should be relatively minor.

5. **Suggestion**: Replace the methoxy group (OCH3) on the phenyl ring with a larger, less favorable group like a sulfonamide group, which is less common in drug-like molecules and could decrease the QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group on the phenyl ring with a sulfonamide group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the input molecule.
2. **Previous Attempts**: The previous modifications involved replacing the fluorine atom with other halogens or a nitro group, which did not change the QED significantly.
3. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. This can be achieved by adding bulky or hydrophobic groups, increasing molecular weight, or reducing solubility.
4. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should be made to parts of the molecule that are less critical to its overall structure to maintain similarity.
5. **Action Space**: Adding or replacing functional groups is likely more effective than deletion, as it can introduce unfavorable drug-like properties without drastically altering the core structure.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluorine atom on the phenyl ring with a tert-butyl group"]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0, we need to consider modifications that will disrupt drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular weight, introducing less favorable functional groups, or reducing solubility. 

From the previous experience, replacing the aromatic ring with a different aromatic system (e.g., replacing "c2ccco2" with "c2ccccc2") did not decrease the QED as expected. Therefore, we need to explore other modifications that could more effectively reduce the QED.

One approach would be to introduce a bulky or less polar functional group in place of a more polar or drug-like group. For example, replacing the amide group (*NC(=O)*) with a less polar or bulkier group could decrease the QED. Additionally, modifying the heterocyclic ring (e.g., replacing the oxygen in the oxazole ring) might also disrupt drug-like properties.

Given the need to maintain similarity, we should aim for a modification that changes the molecule minimally while still achieving the desired QED reduction.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Maintain Similarity**: The modification should be subtle, targeting a specific functional group or atom while keeping the overall structure similar.
2. **Disrupt Drug-likeness**: The change should introduce a group or atom that is less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as increasing steric hindrance or reducing polarity.
3. **Learn from Previous Attempts**: The previous attempt of replacing the aromatic system didn't work, so we should try a different strategy, such as modifying the amide or heterocycle.
4. **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure the suggestion does not repeat the previous modifications.

### Final Suggestion:
```python

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Understanding the Objective**: The goal is to make the molecule less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.8255950768586129 (the QED of the root molecule). The modified molecule should remain similar to the original structure.
2. **Learning from Previous Attempts**: The previous modifications involved extending the carbon chain in the cyclic structure, which slightly increased the QED (0.8489304791829495). This suggests that increasing the length of the carbon chain is not effective for decreasing QED.
3. **Strategies for Reducing QED**:
   - Introduce less drug-like functional groups (e.g., bulky or polar groups).
   - Remove or modify key functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness.
   - Increase the molecule's complexity or introduce steric hindrance.
4. **Action Space**: Based on the guidelines, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups.
5. **Suggesting a Modification**:
   - **Replacement**: Replace the positively charged amino group with a neutral and less polar functional group, such as a hydroxyl group. This reduces the molecule's polarity and drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity.
6. **Similarity Consideration**: Replacing the amino group with a hydroxyl group retains the overall structure but changes the molecule's physicochemical properties, making it less drug-like.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the positively charged amino group with a hydroxyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.0, while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, I will consider the following reasoning process:

1. **Learning from Previous Experience**: The previous suggestion involved modifications to the amide group (CC(=O)NC(N)=O), such as replacing it with other functional groups like methylated amide (CC(=O)N(C)C) or simpler amide (CC(=O)N). These changes did not significantly decrease the QED, and in some cases, increased it. Therefore, we need to explore other functional groups or structural changes that are less drug-like.

2. **Identifying Less Drug-like Features**: Molecules with lower QED values often have features like larger molecular weight, higher hydrophobicity, or the presence of less common functional groups. Since we need to maintain similarity, we should focus on modifying the existing functional groups rather than introducing entirely new ones.

3. **Targeting Specific Functional Groups**: The molecule contains an amide group (CC(=O)NC(N)=O), an ether group (CCO), and a cyclic amine ([NH+]). Modifying these groups, especially the amide, is likely to impact the QED more significantly.

4. **Suggested Modification**: Replace the amide group (CC(=O)NC(N)=O) with a less polar and less drug-like functional group, such as an ester (CC(=O)OC), which is less likely to participate in hydrogen bonding and has a lower QED.

5. **Similarity Consideration**: The ester group is structurally similar to the amide group in terms of carbon chain length and connectivity, ensuring that the overall structure remains similar to the input molecule.

Based on this reasoning, the final suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (CC(=O)NC(N)=O) with an ester group (CC(=O)OC) in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understand the Goal**: The goal is to make the molecule `CCO[C@@H]1CCC[NH+](CC(=O)NC(N)=O)C1` less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The previous attempts involved replacing the amide group with an ester group, but the QED increased, which is the opposite of the desired outcome. This suggests that ester groups may not be the right choice for decreasing QED.

2. **Analyze Previous Attempts**: The QED of the ester-modified molecule (`CCO[C@@H]1CCC[NH+](CC(=O)OC)C1`) was 0.6093827106223054, which is higher than the QED of the root molecule (0.535977402396774). This indicates that esterification does not achieve the desired decrease in QED.

3. **Explore Alternative Modifications**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. One approach could be to replace the amide group with a less polar or less structurally complex functional group. For example, replacing the amide group with a simple alkyl chain might reduce the drug-likeness and decrease QED.

4. **Ensure Similarity**: The modification should maintain structural similarity to the original molecule. Replacing the amide group with a non-polar alkyl group (e.g., a methyl group) would retain the core structure while making the molecule less drug-like.

5. **Avoid Repetition**: The suggestion should not repeat previous modifications, such as esterification.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (CC(=O)NC(N)=O) with a methyl group (C) in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal Analysis**: The task is to modify the molecule **CSc1nnc2n(N)cnn12** to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0, while maintaining structural similarity. The QED of the root molecule is **0.45497591716755464**, and the QED of the previous candidate **CSc1nnc2n(NC)cnn12** is **0.6560432742655012**, which is higher than the root molecule (the opposite of our goal).

2. **Action Space**: We need to either add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups in the molecule. Since the previous attempt (adding a methyl group to the amine nitrogen) increased QED, this suggests that adding small alkyl groups to the amine nitrogen is not effective for decreasing QED. Therefore, we should explore other modifications.

3. **Learn from Previous Experience**: The previous modification added a methyl group to the amine nitrogen, which increased QED. To decrease QED, we should consider:
   - Adding larger or more polar groups.
   - Introducing bulky substituents that might disrupt drug-like properties.
   - Replacing the amine with a less drug-like functional group.

4. **Avoid Repeating Previous Suggestions**: The previous suggestion added a methyl group to the amine nitrogen. We need to suggest a different modification.

5. **Similarity Consideration**: The modification should maintain structural similarity to the input molecule, meaning the core structure (the bicyclic system) should remain intact.

6. **Suggested Modification**:  
   Replace the **amine group** with a **nitro group**, which is a bulkier and more polar functional group, likely to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amine group with a nitro group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task step-by-step and analyze the reasoning process:

---

### **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective**: Decrease the QED of the input molecule `CCN(C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1)c1ccc(C#N)c(Cl)c1` by at least 0, while keeping the modified molecule structurally similar to the input.

2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the input molecule is **0.8168**. The previous attempt replaced the nitrile group (`C#N`) with a carboxyl group (`C(=O)O`), but this **increased** the QED to **0.8778**. This suggests that replacing `C#N` with polar or hydrogen-bonding groups may not be effective for decreasing QED.

3. **Previous Lessons**:
   - Replacing `C#N` with polar groups like `C(=O)O` increased QED, likely due to improved hydrogen bonding or solubility.
   - To decrease QED, we should **reduce** polar or hydrogen-bonding groups and potentially **increase** lipophilicity or molecular weight.

4. **Action Space**: Given the need to maintain similarity, we should target the `C#N` group or other functional groups in the molecule for modification. The suggestion should **not** repeat the previous approach.

5. **Strategic Modification**:
   - Replace the nitrile group (`C#N`) with a less polar or bulkier group, such as an alkyl group or aromatic ring, to reduce polarity and hydrogen-bonding potential.
   - This modification should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

6. **Final Suggestion**: Replace the nitrile group (`C#N`) with a phenyl group (`c1ccccc1`), as this adds lipophilicity and bulk without introducing polar or hydrogen-bonding features.

---

### **Final Suggestion**:  
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitrile group with a phenyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to make the molecule `CN1C(=O)[C@H]2CCCCN2C(=O)[C@@H]1c1ccccc1` less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0, while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **Previous Experience**: The previous attempts to add simple atoms or functional groups (e.g., `C`, `O`, `N`, `F`, `Cl`) to the benzene ring did not significantly decrease QED (in fact, adding `C` increased it).

3. **Action Consideration**: To effectively decrease QED, we need to modify the molecule in a way that introduces features that are less drug-like, such as bulky or polar groups, or by disrupting the aromaticity of the benzene ring.

4. **Similarity Consideration**: To maintain similarity, the modification should be minimal, focusing on replacing or adding functional groups rather than altering the core structure.

5. **Avoid Repetition**: The previous suggestions involved adding atoms directly to the benzene ring. To avoid repetition, the suggestion should involve a different type of modification.

6. **Proposed Action**: Replace the hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with a hydroxyl group. This introduces polarity and disrupts the aromaticity slightly, making the molecule less drug-like. This modification is minimal and maintains similarity to the original structure.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with a hydroxyl group to disrupt aromaticity and introduce polarity."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective**: The goal is to make the molecule CN1C(=O)[C@H]2CCCCN2C(=O)[C@@H]1c1ccccc1 "less like a drug" and decrease its QED by at least 0. The QED of the root molecule is 0.7670746445688948, so the QED of the modified molecule should be below this value.

2. **Previous Attempts**: In previous attempts, adding a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring increased the QED (e.g., CN1C(=O)[C@H]2CCCCN2C(=O)[C@@H]1c1cc(O)ccc1 had a QED of 0.8390470267779867), which is counterproductive to the goal.

3. **Learning from Failures**: Adding polar groups like hydroxyl or halogens to the benzene ring tends to increase QED, which is undesirable. To decrease QED, we need to reduce the drug-likeness by introducing less favorable features, such as larger or more hydrophobic groups, or disrupting aromaticity in a way that introduces steric hindrance.

4. **Proposed Action**: Replace a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with a phenyl group to introduce steric bulk, reduce drug-likeness, and disrupt the molecule's overall favorable properties. This modification is less likely to increase QED and maintains some structural similarity to the original molecule.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with a phenyl group to introduce steric bulk and reduce drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to make the molecule less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the original.
2. **Previous Experience**: In the previous attempt, replacing the nitro group (`[N+](=O)[O-]`) with a simple alkyl group (`CC`) increased the QED, which is the opposite of the desired outcome. This suggests that replacing the nitro group with a less polar or more complex group might be effective.
3. **Action Space**: The suggested actions are to add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group. Since the nitro group is a key functional group that influences the drug-likeness, replacing it with a different group could be effective.
4. **Similarity Consideration**: To maintain similarity, the modification should be localized to the nitro group or its immediate vicinity.
5. **Avoid Repetition**: The previous suggestion replaced the nitro group with an ethyl group (`CC`). Therefore, the new suggestion should avoid this specific replacement.
6. **QED Reduction**: To reduce QED, the modification should introduce a less polar or more bulky group, which typically decreases the drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
The best approach is to replace the nitro group (`[N+](=O)[O-]`) with a bulky, less polar group such as a tert-butyl group. This modification should decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let’s analyze the task step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule CCS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)N(Cc2ccccn2)c2nc3ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc3s2)cc1 to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Attempts**: The previous attempt replaced the nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]) with a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), but this increased the QED from 0.2849989164024345 to 0.3477601594306541, which is opposite to the desired outcome. This suggests that introducing bulky hydrophobic groups like tert-butyl may not be effective in decreasing QED.

3. **Learning from Experience**: To decrease QED, we should avoid introducing hydrophobic or large groups. Instead, we can focus on adding polar or less drug-like features while maintaining structural similarity. Functional groups like carboxylic acids, sulfonamides, or alcohols can reduce QED due to their polarity and reduced drug-likeness.

4. **Action Space**: Replace a specific functional group or atom with a less drug-like or more polar functional group to decrease QED.

5. **Similarity Consideration**: The modification should preserve the core structure of the molecule, focusing on replacing or altering small functional groups rather than making drastic changes.

6. **New Suggestion**: Replace the nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]) with a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)OOH). This introduces a highly polar and less drug-like feature, which is likely to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Reasoning:
- The nitro group is a common drug-like feature, and replacing it with a carboxylic acid introduces polarity, reducing drug-likeness.
- This modification avoids the use of bulky hydrophobic groups, which previously increased QED.
- The carboxylic acid group maintains structural similarity to the input molecule while altering its properties to achieve the desired outcome.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a carboxylic acid group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Alright, let's break this down step-by-step to ensure we meet the objectives:

### **Understanding the Problem**
1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule `CNc1ccc2nc(-c3ccc(F)c(F)c3F)[nH]c2n1` to make it "less like a drug" by decreasing its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0. The modified molecule should still be similar to the original.
2. **Current QED**: The root molecule has a QED of 0.7082.
3. **Previous Attempts**: In the previous suggestions, fluorine atoms were replaced with other halogens (Cl, Br, I) or a hydroxyl group, but these changes either didn't decrease QED enough or increased it (e.g., replacing F with C increased QED to 0.7539).

### **Key Considerations**
1. **QED Decrease**: To decrease QED, we need to make the molecule less drug-like. This typically involves:
   - Increasing molecular weight.
   - Introducing bulky or polar groups.
   - Reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.
   - Decreasing lipophilicity.
2. **Similarity**: The modified molecule should still resemble the original structure, so we’ll focus on small, targeted changes.

### **Analyzing the Previous Suggestions**
- Replacing fluorine (F) with chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), or a hydroxyl group (OH) didn't decrease QED significantly. In fact, replacing F with C increased QED.
- This suggests that replacing fluorine with heavier atoms or polar groups might not be effective here.

### **Potential Strategies**
1. **Introduce a Bulky Group**: Adding a bulky group could disrupt drug-likeness. For example, replacing a fluorine atom with a tert-butyl group.
2. **Increase Polarity**: Adding a polar group like a nitro group or a sulfone could decrease QED.
3. **Modify the Core Structure**: Slightly altering the core heterocycle (e.g., adding a methyl group to the pyrimidine ring) might reduce drug-likeness while maintaining similarity.

### **Final Selection**
Based on the above reasoning, here’s the top suggestion:

1. **Replace one of the fluorine atoms with a nitro group**: This introduces polarity and increases molecular weight, which should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### **Python List**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the fluorine atoms in the aromatic ring with a nitro group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

### Goal:
We need to modify the molecule `CCCCCOc1ccc(C(N)=S)cc1` to make it less like a drug by decreasing its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain similar to the original molecule.

### Key Considerations:
1. **QED Reduction**: The previous attempt to modify the molecule by replacing the thioamide group (`C(N)=S`) with a carbonyl group (`C(N)=O`) actually increased the QED (from 0.594 to 0.728). This suggests that reducing QED might require modifications that introduce less polar or less drug-like features.
2. **Molecule Similarity**: The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the original molecule, meaning we should avoid drastic changes.
3. **Exploration of New Modifications**: We should not repeat the previous modification (replacing the thioamide group with a carbonyl group).

### Potential Strategy:
Since the previous modification increased QED, we need to explore different changes that could reduce QED. One approach is to modify the thioamide group further by introducing less polar or bulky groups, or by altering other parts of the molecule, such as the benzene ring or the ether linker.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the above reasoning, the best suggestion is to replace the thioamide group with a less polar and bulkier group, such as a tert-butyl group, to decrease QED while maintaining similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the thioamide group (C(N)=S) with a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)(C))"]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal Analysis**: The goal is to modify the molecule `CCCCCOc1ccc(C(N)=S)cc1` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain similar to the original structure.

2. **Previous Experience**: 
   - Replacing the thioamide group (`C(N)=S`) with a tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`) increased the QED, which is the opposite of what we want.
   - Therefore, we need to avoid modifications that increase the QED or add bulky, non-polar groups like tert-butyl.

3. **Strategy**:
   - To decrease QED, we should consider introducing less drug-like features such as polar groups, larger structures, or more complex functionalities.
   - The modification should be subtle to maintain similarity to the original molecule.

4. **Suggested Action**:
   - Replace the thioamide group (`C(N)=S`) with a less drug-like functional group. For example, replacing it with a sulfonamide group (`S(N)(=O)=O`) could reduce drug-likeness and QED.

5. **Similarity Consideration**:
   - The sulfonamide group is structurally similar to the thioamide group but has different properties, which should help achieve the goal of reducing QED while maintaining some structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the thioamide group with a sulfonamide group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to make the molecule less like a drug and decrease the QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should retain similarity to the input molecule.
2. **Previous Experience**: In the previous suggestions, modifications included removing the chlorine atom, replacing it with a bromine atom, and altering the functional groups on the heterocycle. These changes have varying effects on QED, but none achieved a significant decrease beyond the threshold.
3. **Chemical Similarity**: To maintain similarity, the modifications should be localized and not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule.
4. **QED Reduction**: To reduce QED, we can introduce groups or atoms that are less favorable in drug-likeness metrics, such as large hydrophobic groups, polar groups, or reducing the number of aromatic rings.
5. **Action Space**: Based on the guidelines, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. Given the need to reduce QED and maintain similarity, replacing a small functional group with a less favorable one is a viable strategy.

### Suggested Modification:
To reduce QED and maintain similarity, I suggest replacing the **methyl group** attached to the nitrogen in the triazole ring with a **hydroxyl group**. This replacement increases polarity and reduces drug-likeness, thus decreasing QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methyl group attached to the nitrogen in the triazole ring with a hydroxyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal Understanding**: The task is to modify the molecule `C=CCOc1ccc(CN2Cc3ccccc3C[C@@H]2c2nnc(C)o2)cc1Cl` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should still be structurally similar to the original.

2. **Previous Attempts**: Previous suggestions involved replacing the methyl group attached to the nitrogen in the triazole ring with a hydroxyl group, which increased the QED instead of decreasing it. This indicates that adding polar groups like hydroxyl might not be effective in reducing QED.

3. **QED Considerations**: QED is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we need to increase molecular weight, reduce polarity, or introduce features that make the molecule less drug-like.

4. **Structural Similarity**: The modification should preserve the core structure of the molecule, particularly the triazole ring and the chlorine-substituted phenyl ring, to maintain similarity.

5. **Action Space**: Based on the action space, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. Considering the previous failure, we need to avoid adding polar groups and focus on increasing molecular weight or introducing less polar moieties.

6. **Suggestion**: Replace the chlorine atom with a larger, less polar substituent like a bromine atom. This increases molecular weight and reduces polarity slightly while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the chlorine atom on the phenyl ring with a bromine atom."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to make the molecule "Cc1nc(CNC(=O)CNC(=O)CC23CC4CC(CC(C4)C2)C3)c(C)s1" less like a drug by decreasing its QED by at least 0.8025149744794334. The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the original.

2. **Previous Attempts:** The previous modifications involved changing the sulfur atom in the thiophene ring to different atoms (S, O, N, F). However, these changes did not significantly decrease the QED, as the QED remained the same in the previous candidate.

3. **Strategy:** To achieve a significant decrease in QED, we need to modify the molecule in a way that disrupts its drug-like properties more effectively. This could involve altering functional groups or adding/removing atoms that are typically associated with undesirable drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular weight, introducing hydrophobicity, or reducing solubility.

4. **Similarity Consideration:** The modification should not drastically change the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

5. **Suggested Action:** Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) in the amide linkage with a less polar group, such as a methylene group (CH2). This change will reduce the polarity of the molecule, potentially decreasing its QED.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide linkage with a methylene group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: The goal is to make the molecule less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule. Based on the previous information, the QED of the root molecule is 0.683, and the previous candidate had a QED of 0.785, which is higher than the root molecule. This suggests that adding alkyl groups (like in the previous candidate) may not be an effective strategy, as it increased the QED instead of decreasing it.

To decrease QED, we should focus on making the molecule less drug-like by introducing less favorable drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular weight, introducing polar groups, or adding steric hindrance. Additionally, we should avoid repeating the previous modification of adding alkyl groups. 

A potential strategy is to introduce a hydroxyl group, as it increases polarity and may reduce drug-likeness. This modification also maintains structural similarity to the original molecule.

**Reasoning:**
1. Adding a hydroxyl group increases polarity, which can decrease QED.
2. The hydroxyl group is a small modification that maintains structural similarity.
3. This modification has not been attempted in the previous suggestions.

Based on this reasoning, the top-1 suggestion is to **add a hydroxyl group to the nitrogen atom in the pyrimidine ring**.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to the nitrogen atom in the pyrimidine ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while keeping the modified molecule structurally similar to the original.
2. **Previous Experience**: The previous attempt involved adding a methyl group or a carbonyl group to the nitrogen in the piperazine ring, which actually increased the QED. This suggests that adding small, polar, or lipophilic groups may not be effective in reducing QED.
3. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are less drug-like, such as larger or more complex substituents, or modifications that increase molecular weight or reduce solubility.
4. **Similarity Consideration**: The modification should be localized to maintain structural similarity. A good candidate for modification is the aromatic ring or the piperazine ring, as these are central to the molecule's structure.
5. **Action Space**: Based on the previous failure, replacing an atom or functional group with a less drug-like moiety could be more effective than simple additions.

### Suggested Modification:
- Replace one of the fluorine atoms on the aromatic ring with a bulkier, less polar group like a tert-butyl group. This will increase the molecular weight and reduce the drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the fluorine atoms on the aromatic ring with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's carefully analyze the task and constraints:

**Goal Analysis:**
1. We need to modify the molecule CC(C)(CO[N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)Cl to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.
2. The molecule should remain similar to the original structure.
3. We must consider previous modifications (bromine, iodine, methoxy, thiomethyl, and amine substitutions) that didn't achieve the desired QED decrease.

**Key Observations from Previous Attempts:**
- Halogen substitutions (Br, I) increased QED instead of decreasing it.
- Ether (OC) and thioether (SC) substitutions also didn't achieve the target.
- The amine substitution (NC) might have maintained drug-like properties.

**Strategy for QED Reduction:**
To decrease QED, we should:
1. Increase molecular weight beyond typical drug range
2. Reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors
3. Introduce bulky groups that reduce bioavailability
4. Modify the nitro group, as it's a strong electron-withdrawing group contributing to drug-like properties

**Proposed Modification:**
Replace the nitro group with a bulky, less polar group to reduce hydrogen bonding potential and increase steric hindrance while maintaining some structural similarity.

Given these considerations, here's the top suggestion:

final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]) with a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) to increase steric bulk and reduce polarity while maintaining structural similarity."]

AI Suggestion 0: Reasoning process:

1. The goal is to make the molecule less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0, while maintaining structural similarity to the input molecule.
2. Previous attempts involved modifying the terminal oxygen atom (changing it to different atoms or groups), but this increased the QED instead of decreasing it.
3. To decrease QED, we should consider adding bulkier or less polar groups, or introducing features that reduce drug-likeness.
4. The molecule has a thiophene ring (ccsc1) that could be a target for modification, as aromatic systems contribute to drug-likeness.
5. The amide group (N(C)C(=O)) is another potential target, as modifying it could significantly affect drug-likeness.

Considering these points, a good strategy would be to modify the amide group while maintaining the overall structure. Adding bulkier or less polar groups to the amide nitrogen could decrease QED while preserving similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Task**: The goal is to modify the molecule `C[C@@H]([NH2+]C1CCCCCC1)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should still be similar to the original molecule.

2. **Analyzing Previous Attempts**: The previous modifications involved shortening the cyclohexane ring (`C1CCCCCC1`) to smaller rings (`C1CCCCC1`, `C1CCCC1`, etc.). This actually increased the QED in the case of `C[C@@H]([NH2+]C1CCCCC1)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1` (QED = 0.658), which is contrary to the desired effect. Therefore, reducing the ring size is not an effective strategy for decreasing QED.

3. **Alternative Strategies**: Since reducing the ring size increased QED, we need to consider other modifications that could decrease QED while maintaining molecular similarity. Potential strategies include:
   - Adding a bulky or hydrophobic group to increase molecular weight and reduce solubility.
   - Introducing a polar group that disrupts drug-like properties.
   - Replacing a functional group with one that is less drug-like.

4. **Balancing Similarity and QED**: The modification should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule, ensuring similarity is maintained.

5. **Final Suggestion**: Based on the above reasoning, a suitable modification would be to replace the nitro group (`[N+](=O)[O-]`) with a less polar or bulkier group, such as a methyl group. This change is expected to decrease QED without significantly altering the molecular structure.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a methyl group on the benzene ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule `C[C@@H]([NH2+]C1CCCCCC1)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should still be similar to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Attempts**: 
   - Replacing the nitro group with a methyl group increased the QED (0.7697835858113937), which is contrary to the goal.
   - Simple modifications to the cyclohexane ring did not achieve the desired QED decrease.

3. **Considerations**:
   - We need to reduce the QED, which often involves making the molecule less polar, less soluble, or more complex.
   - We should avoid repeating previous attempts such as replacing the nitro group with a methyl group or altering the cyclohexane ring.
   - The modification should maintain some structural similarity to the original molecule.

4. **Suggested Action**:
   - **Replace the nitro group on the benzene ring with a hydrophobic group**: This could decrease the QED by reducing the polarity and solubility of the molecule. A good candidate is replacing the nitro group with a tert-butyl group, which is bulky and hydrophobic.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group on the benzene ring with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To address the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.4714701337790575 (the root QED), while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, let's consider the following steps:

### Reasoning Process:
1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: The previous attempt replaced the nitro group (NO2) with a hydroxyl group (OH), which unexpectedly increased the QED to 0.7445453081935253. This suggests that replacing NO2 with a more complex or less polar group might be more effective in reducing QED.

2. **Chemical Similarity**: To maintain similarity, we should focus on modifications to the nitro group or other functional groups that are already present in the molecule.

3. **Previous Mistakes**: The previous attempt failed to reduce QED, likely because the hydroxyl group is too polar and drug-like. We should avoid similar polar modifications and instead consider larger, less polar, or more sterically hindered groups.

4. **Strategic Modification**: Replacing the nitro group with a bulky, non-polar group like a tert-butyl group or an aromatic ring could decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a tert-butyl group on the phenyl ring."]
``` 

This suggestion avoids repeating previous attempts, introduces a less polar group, and maintains structural similarity to the input molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: Let's carefully analyze the task and follow the guidelines step-by-step:

### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: To make the molecule less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The molecule should remain structurally similar to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Attempts**: 
   - The initial modifications (e.g., replacing the nitro group with hydroxyl, chlorine, bromine, methyl, or methoxy) did not achieve the goal.
   - Replacing the nitro group with a tert-butyl group increased the QED instead of decreasing it (QED rose to 0.6546310779035001).

3. **Learning from Experience**:
   - Replacing the nitro group with a bulky group (tert-butyl) did not work as intended.
   - Functional groups that increase lipophilicity or bulkiness may not always decrease QED, especially if they improve drug-likeness.

4. **Suggested Strategy**:
   - To decrease QED, consider making the molecule less drug-like by introducing groups that disrupt solubility, polarity, or molecular complexity.
   - The modification should focus on the phenyl ring with the nitro group, as earlier attempts targeted this region.

5. **Action Space**:
   - Replace the nitro group with a highly hydrophobic group, but not one that improves drug-likeness (e.g., avoid tert-butyl).
   - Introduce a less polar group that disrupts the molecule's balance of properties.

6. **Suggested Modification**:
   - Replace the nitro group with a trifluoromethyl group. This group is highly hydrophobic, reduces polarity, and is less likely to improve drug-likeness compared to a nitro group.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group on the phenyl ring with a trifluoromethyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease the QED by at least 0, while keeping the molecule similar to the input.

2. **Previous Experience**: The previous modification involved changing the sulfone group (S(=O)(=O)) to a sulfoxide group (S(=O)), which actually increased the QED (from 0.669 to 0.697). This suggests that reducing the oxidation state of sulfur does not achieve the desired effect. Therefore, modifying the sulfur-containing group might not be the right approach.

3. **Alternative Strategy**: To decrease the QED, consider altering other parts of the molecule, such as the amine group or the carbonyl group, which are known to contribute to drug-likeness. Introducing bulkier or more polar groups could decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

4. **Specific Action**: Replace the carbonyl group (C(N)=O) with a less polar group, such as a methylene group (CH2). This will reduce the polarity and likely decrease the QED.

5. **Similarity Consideration**: This modification changes only one functional group while keeping the rest of the molecule intact, ensuring the molecule remains similar to the input.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group (C(N)=O) with a methylene group (CH2)."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The goal is to modify the molecule `CC[NH2+][C@@]1(C(N)=O)CCC[C@H](N(C)[C@@H]2CCS(=O)(=O)C2)C1` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The output molecule should retain similarity to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Experience:** 
   - The carbonyl group was replaced with a methylene group, but this increased the QED instead of decreasing it.
   - The QED of the original molecule is 0.669, and the modified molecule with the methylene group has a QED of 0.814, which is higher than the target.

3. **Strategy:**
   - To decrease the QED, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as adding bulky groups, reducing polarity, or introducing less favorable functional groups.
   - The modification should be subtle to maintain similarity but significant enough to affect the QED negatively.

4. **Action Space:**
   - **Add:** Introduce a bulky group or a less favorable functional group.
   - **Delete:** Remove a functional group that contributes to drug-likeness.
   - **Replace:** Swap a favorable functional group with a less favorable one.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - **Add a bulky group to the molecule to reduce its drug-likeness.** Specifically, adding a tert-butyl group (−C(CH3)3) to the molecule could increase steric hindrance and make the molecule less drug-like, thereby decreasing its QED.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a tert-butyl group to the molecule to increase steric hindrance and reduce drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let’s break this down step-by-step:

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0, while maintaining similarity.
2. **Current Molecule**: COc1ccc(N2C(=O)N3CCC4=c5ccccc5=[NH+][C@@H]4[C@@]3(C)C2=O)c(OC)c1 with QED 0.7197976396300599.
3. **Previous Attempts**: The previous modifications involved stereochemistry changes or minor additions to the structure, but the QED remained unchanged.
4. **Key Insight**: The QED can be reduced by introducing features that are less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, adding bulky groups, or introducing less polar or more complex structures.
5. **Similarity Consideration**: The modification should retain the core structure (e.g., the aromatic ring, amide, and cyclic systems) to ensure similarity.

### Suggested Modification:
To decrease QED while maintaining similarity, I suggest replacing one of the methyl groups in the methoxy (OC) groups with a bulkier, less polar group. This will reduce drug-likeness without drastically altering the core structure.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the methoxy groups (OC) attached to the aromatic ring with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The task is to modify the molecule `COc1ccc(N2C(=O)N3CCC4=c5ccccc5=[NH+][C@@H]4[C@@]3(C)C2=O)c(OC)c1` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should retain structural similarity to the original.

2. **Previous Attempts**: In previous attempts, methoxy groups on the aromatic ring were replaced with tert-butyl groups, but this did not achieve the desired decrease in QED. The QED actually increased slightly.

3. **Current Best Molecule**: The current best molecule is `COc1ccc(N2C(=O)N3CCC4=c5ccccc5=[NH+][C@@H]4[C@@]3(C)C2=O)c(OC)c1`.

4. **Analysis**: The presence of methoxy groups (`OCH3`) and the complex ring system with amide and imide functionalities likely contribute to the drug-like properties and higher QED. To decrease QED, we need to introduce less polar or more sterically hindered groups that disrupt the drug-like character.

5. **Action Space**: The action space includes adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups. Given that replacing methoxy groups with tert-butyl groups did not work, we need a different approach.

6. **Strategy**: 
   - **Introducing Bulky, Non-Polar Groups**: Adding bulky, non-polar groups can decrease QED by reducing solubility and making the molecule less drug-like.
   - **Breaking Symmetry**: Altering the symmetry of the molecule can also reduce drug-likeness.
   - **Replacing Polar Groups**: Replacing polar groups with less polar or hydrophobic groups can decrease QED.

7. **Proposed Modification**: Replace one of the methoxy groups on the aromatic ring with a phenyl group. Phenyl groups are bulky and non-polar, which should decrease QED while maintaining some structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the methoxy groups on the aromatic ring with a phenyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The task is to modify the molecule `N#Cc1ccccc1NC(=O)CC[NH+]1C[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C1` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain similar to the original.

2. **Previous Attempts:** In the previous suggestions, additional carbon atoms were added to the molecule, which increased the QED. This indicates that adding hydrophobic groups (like alkyl chains) might not be the optimal strategy for decreasing QED.

3. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we should focus on modifications that reduce the drug-like properties, such as:
   - Adding polar or bulky groups that disrupt the molecule's solubility or binding potential.
   - Removing or replacing functional groups that are typically associated with drug-likeness.

4. **Action Plan:** A good approach would be to replace the amide group (`NC(=O)`) with a less drug-like functional group, such as an ester or ether group. This would maintain some similarity while reducing the QED.

5. **Final Suggestion:** Replace the amide group (`NC(=O)`) with an ester group (`O=C(O)`).

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with an ester group (O=C(O)) in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0, we need to consider modifications that reduce drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity to the input molecule. From the previous suggestions, we observed that replacing the nitro group with a hydroxyl group increased the QED, which is contrary to our goal. Therefore, we should avoid such modifications.

Instead, we can consider adding or replacing functional groups that are less common in drug-like molecules, such as bulky or polar groups, which might decrease the QED. Additionally, we should ensure that the modifications do not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

Based on this reasoning, here is a top-1 suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a sulfonic acid group to decrease drug-likeness and QED."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0, while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to consider the following reasoning steps:

1. **Learn from Previous Experience**: 
   - Replacing the nitro group with a sulfonic acid group increased the QED, which is contrary to our goal. This suggests that introducing highly polar or charged groups may not always decrease QED.
   - To decrease QED, we should consider reducing the polarity or introducing bulkier, less drug-like substituents.

2. **Avoid Repeating Previous Suggestions**: 
   - The previous modifications involved replacing the nitro group with a sulfonic acid group and its derivatives. We should avoid suggesting these again.

3. **Consider Similarity**: 
   - The modification should target a functional group or atom that is not part of the core structure to maintain molecular similarity.

4. **Action Space**: 
   - We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. Since deleting atoms or groups might significantly alter the structure, replacing a functional group might be more effective in maintaining similarity.

5. **Potential Target**: 
   - The carbonyl group (C=O) in the amide linkage is a good target because modifying it can reduce polarity and drug-likeness without drastically changing the core structure.

**Reasoning for Final Suggestion**:
- Replace the carbonyl group in the amide linkage with a less polar and bulkier group, such as a methylene group, to reduce drug-likeness and QED. This modification reduces polarity while maintaining the overall structure of the molecule.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide linkage with a methylene group to reduce polarity and decrease drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0, we need to consider modifications that reduce its drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule. Based on the previous suggestions, we should avoid repeating the same modifications.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Previous Modifications**: The previous suggestions involved removing or altering the fluorine atoms (`F`) and the methoxy groups (`OCH3`). These modifications slightly increased the QED, which is not desired.
2. **Target Functional Groups**: To decrease QED and retain similarity, we should focus on functional groups that are less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as large hydrophobic or bulky groups.
3. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.
4. **Avoid Repeats**: We should avoid modifying the same parts of the molecule as in previous suggestions (e.g., fluorine atoms and methoxy groups).

### Suggested Modification:
Replace the morpholine ring (`[C@@H]2CCCO2`) with a more bulky and less drug-like group, such as a cyclohexane ring. This modification will increase the hydrophobic character of the molecule, reducing its QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the morpholine ring with a cyclohexane ring to increase hydrophobicity and reduce drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Reasoning process:
1. The goal is to decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.8225497625605974 (root_property) while maintaining structural similarity.
2. The previous attempts included modifying the amine group and introducing aromatic substitutions, but these either increased QED or did not decrease it sufficiently.
3. To further decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-likeness, such as adding bulkier or less polar groups, or breaking key drug-like features.
4. To maintain similarity, we should focus on modifications that do not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule.
5. A good strategy is to replace a functional group with a less favorable one for drug-likeness, such as converting the amine group to a bulkier or less polar group.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0, while maintaining structural similarity, we need to consider modifications that reduce drug-likeness. Drug-likeness is often associated with properties such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and the presence of specific functional groups. To decrease QED, we can introduce changes that make the molecule larger, more hydrophobic, or less compatible with typical drug-like properties.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Learn from Previous Experience**: The previous attempts did not change the QED value, indicating that small stereochemical or conformational changes are insufficient. We need a more significant modification.
2. **Modification Strategy**: Introducing a bulky or hydrophobic group can reduce drug-likeness. For example, adding a long alkyl chain or a large aromatic system could achieve this.
3. **Maintain Similarity**: The modification should be localized to a specific part of the molecule to maintain overall structural similarity.
4. **Avoid Repeat Suggestions**: The previous suggestions focused on stereochemistry and small ring changes. We need a different approach.

### Final Suggestion:
Add a long alkyl chain to the benzene ring to increase hydrophobicity and molecular weight, thereby reducing drug-likeness and QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a long alkyl chain to the benzene ring to increase hydrophobicity and molecular weight."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Objective**:  
   - The goal is to make the molecule less like a drug by decreasing its QED by at least 0, while maintaining structural similarity to the input molecule.

2. **Learning from Previous Experience**:  
   - In the previous attempt, modifications were made by replacing atoms or functional groups in the `n3cccc[nH+]3` part of the molecule. The QED increased slightly, which is contrary to the desired effect. This suggests that modifications in this region might not be effective for decreasing QED.

3. **Identifying Alternative Modification Sites**:  
   - To decrease QED, we should consider modifying regions of the molecule that are less likely to increase drug-likeness. The methoxy group (`CO`) on the benzene ring could be a good candidate for modification because it is a common drug-like feature.

4. **Proposing a Modification**:  
   - Replacing the methoxy group with a bulkier or less polar group could decrease QED and make the molecule less drug-like. For example, replacing the methoxy group with a tert-butyl group would increase steric hindrance and reduce polarity.

5. **Ensuring Similarity**:  
   - The modification should retain the core structure of the molecule, ensuring that the overall similarity is maintained despite the change.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group on the benzene ring with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the intent of the $root_question, we need to make the molecule less like a drug and decrease the QED by at least 0. Considering the previous suggestions, we should avoid repeating the replacement of the methoxy group with a tert-butyl group, as it did not achieve the desired decrease in QED. Instead, we should focus on modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule while maintaining its structural similarity.

From previous experiences, adding bulky or polar groups often decreases QED, as these groups can disrupt the molecule's physicochemical properties that are favorable for drug-likeness. Introducing a polar functional group, such as a hydroxyl group, could be a suitable strategy. This modification retains the overall structure of the molecule but reduces its drug-likeness due to increased polarity.

Therefore, the top suggestion is:
**"Replace the hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group."**

This modification should decrease the QED while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal Analysis**: The task is to modify the molecule `Cc1occc1C(=O)N1CCC[C@@H]1C(N)=O` to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The previous attempts did not achieve the desired QED decrease, so a more significant structural change is needed.

2. **Previous Experience**: The previous modifications included stereochemical changes and minor alterations to the functional groups, but these did not sufficiently lower the QED. Therefore, a more substantial change, such as replacing or adding a functional group, might be necessary.

3. **Chemical Intuition**: To decrease the QED, we can introduce less drug-like features, such as larger or more polar groups, or disrupt favorable drug-like properties like hydrogen bonding or lipophilicity.

4. **Similarity Consideration**: The modification should still preserve the core structure of the molecule, such as the thiophene ring and the amide linkage, to maintain similarity.

5. **Proposed Modification**: A feasible approach is to **replace the amide group with a bulkier and less polar ester group**, which would likely decrease the QED while keeping the core structure intact.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (C(=O)N) with an ester group (C(=O)O) to decrease QED while maintaining similarity."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the molecule `Cc1c(C(=O)N[C@H](C[S@@](C)=O)c2ccccc2)cnn1C(C)C` to make it "less like a drug" and decrease its QED by at least 0, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **Previous Attempts**: The previous modifications focused on altering the `C(C)C` group at the end of the molecule by adding or extending alkyl chains. However, these changes resulted in an **increase** in QED (e.g., `C(C)(C)C` increased QED to 0.9044), which is contrary to the goal.

3. **Learning from Previous Attempts**:
   - Adding alkyl groups (e.g., `C(C)(C)C`, `C(C)CC`) increases QED, likely because these groups improve drug-likeness by enhancing lipophilicity and reducing polarity.
   - To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-likeness, such as increasing polarity, adding bulky or polar groups, or disrupting planarity.

4. **Key Areas for Modification**:
   - The `C[S@@](C)=O` group (sulfoxide) could be modified to increase polarity.
   - The `C(C)C` group could be replaced with a more polar or bulkier group.
   - The aromatic ring `c2ccccc2` could be modified to disrupt planarity.

5. **Suggested Modification**: Replace the `C(C)C` group with a more polar and bulky group, such as a hydroxyl-containing group, to decrease QED while maintaining similarity to the original molecule.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the terminal C(C)C group with a hydroxyl-containing group to increase polarity and bulkiness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the molecule \( \text{CC[C@@H](C)NC(=O)[C@H](C)OCCOC} \) to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while keeping the modified molecule structurally similar to the original.

2. **Previous Experience:** From the previous messages, the modification involved changing the ether linkage (\( \text{OCCOC} \)) to longer alkyl chains (e.g., \( \text{OCCCC} \), \( \text{OCCCCCC} \)). However, this resulted in an increase in QED, which is not desirable. Therefore, we need to explore different modifications.

3. **Action Space:** We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. To decrease QED, we should consider introducing less favorable drug-like features, such as larger or more rigid groups, or groups that disrupt favorable interactions.

4. **Similarity Consideration:** We need to ensure that the modifications do not drastically alter the overall structure of the molecule, maintaining its similarity to the original.

5. **Avoid Repetition:** The previous suggestions focused on extending the alkyl chain. To avoid repetition, we should consider different types of modifications, such as introducing aromatic rings or bulkier groups.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the oxygen atom in the ether linkage (OCCOC) with a benzene ring to introduce a bulkier and less drug-like feature."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal Analysis**: The primary objective is to modify the molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The previous attempts involved replacing the oxygen atom in the ether linkage with a benzene ring, which inadvertently increased the QED. This suggests that introducing aromatic rings may not be the best strategy for decreasing QED.

2. **Learning from Previous Experience**: The substitution of the oxygen atom with a benzene ring increased the QED, indicating that bulkier and aromatic groups might not be effective in reducing QED. Therefore, alternative modifications should be considered.

3. **Suggestion Criteria**: The modification should be similar to the input molecule in structure, but the change should introduce features that are less drug-like and decrease QED. Additionally, the suggestion should not repeat previous attempts.

4. **Potential Modifications**:
   - Introducing a less polar group to reduce drug-likeness.
   - Adding a bulkier aliphatic chain to disrupt the molecular planarity.
   - Removing or replacing functional groups that are commonly found in drugs.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ether linkage (OCCOC) with a longer aliphatic chain to disrupt the molecular planarity and reduce polarity."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the molecule `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(CNC(=O)[C@H]2CCC[NH+](C)C2)o1` to make it less like a drug by decreasing its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the input molecule.
2. **Previous Experience**: In the previous suggestions, modifications were made to the pyrrolidine ring (e.g., removing or altering the nitrogen atom). However, these changes did not significantly decrease the QED, as the QED remained the same. This suggests that modifying the pyrrolidine ring alone may not be sufficient to achieve the desired QED decrease.
3. **Action Space**: I will consider adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups outside the pyrrolidine ring to achieve the goal. For example, modifying the ester group (`CCOC(=O)`) or the amide group (`CNC(=O)`) might be more effective.
4. **Similarity**: The modification should keep the core structure intact to maintain similarity, while introducing changes that reduce drug-likeness.
5. **Suggestions**: I will focus on replacing the ester group with a less polar or less drug-like functional group, as this could decrease the QED significantly.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ester group (CCOC(=O)) with a non-polar alkyl chain to reduce polarity and drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The goal is to modify the molecule `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(CNC(=O)[C@H]2CCC[NH+](C)C2)o1` to make it less drug-like and decrease the QED by at least 0. The previous modifications focused on replacing the ester group with non-polar alkyl chains, but the QED increased, which is not desired.

2. **Learning from Previous Attempts**: The previous attempt to replace the ester group with an ethyl chain (`CCOCc1ccc(CNC(=O)[C@H]2CCC[NH+](C)C2)o1`) resulted in an increased QED (0.7913), which is contrary to the goal. This suggests that simply reducing polarity by replacing the ester group with an alkyl chain may not be effective in decreasing QED.

3. **Alternative Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that reduce the molecule's drug-likeness. One approach is to introduce bulkier or more complex groups that are less favorable in drug-like molecules. For example, replacing the ester group with a more complex, non-polar, or sterically hindered group could be effective.

4. **Ensuring Similarity**: The modification should maintain some structural similarity to the original molecule, so we should avoid making drastic changes that completely alter the core structure.

5. **Avoiding Repetition**: The previous suggestions focused on replacing the ester group with simple non-polar chains. To avoid repetition, we should consider a different type of substituent or functional group.

6. **Final Decision**: Based on the above reasoning, the best suggestion is to replace the ester group with a more complex, non-polar, and sterically hindered substituent, such as a tert-butyl group, which could reduce the drug-likeness and decrease QED.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ester group with a tert-butyl group to introduce steric hindrance and reduce drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the molecule `CC1(C)CCCC[C@H]1[NH2+]C[C@H](O)COc1ccccc1F` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the original.

2. **Previous Attempts**: In the previous attempts, the fluorine atom on the benzene ring was replaced with heavier halogens (Cl, Br, I), a methoxy group (OC), and a nitro group (NO2). However, these modifications either did not decrease the QED significantly or even increased it (e.g., QED increased from 0.844 to 0.847 when F was replaced with Cl).

3. **Learnings**: 
   - Replacing the fluorine atom with heavier halogens or electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy) did not achieve the desired decrease in QED.
   - The nitro group substitution also did not work as expected, possibly due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature, which can sometimes enhance drug-likeness.

4. **Strategy**: To decrease the QED, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. This can be achieved by:
   - Introducing bulky or less common functional groups.
   - Reducing the complexity or symmetry of the molecule.
   - Removing or modifying polar groups that contribute to drug-likeness.

5. **Proposed Modification**: Replace the hydroxyl group (`OH`) on the chiral carbon with a less polar and bulkier group, such as a methyl group. This modification reduces the polarity and complexity of the molecule, which should decrease its QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the chiral carbon with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0, I will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Molecule and Previous Attempts**: The molecule in question is `CC1(C)CCCC[C@H]1[NH2+]C[C@H](O)COc1ccccc1F`. Previous attempts involved replacing the hydroxyl group on the chiral carbon with a methyl group, but this increased the QED instead of decreasing it. Therefore, we need to explore other modifications.

2. **Identify Functional Groups**: The molecule contains a fluorine atom, a hydroxyl group, an amine group, and a cyclohexane ring. These functional groups are important to consider for modification.

3. **Consider QED-Decreasing Changes**: To decrease QED, we should consider:
   - Increasing molecular weight.
   - Introducing more polar or bulky groups.
   - Reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

4. **Ensure Structural Similarity**: The modifications should retain the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.

5. **Explore Alternative Modifications**:
   - **Replace the Fluorine Atom**: Fluorine is a small, electronegative atom. Replacing it with a bulkier halogen like bromine or iodine could decrease QED.
   - **Modify the Hydroxyl Group**: Instead of replacing it with a methyl group, consider converting it to an ether or removing it entirely.
   - **Introduce a Bulky Substituent**: Adding a bulky group like a tert-butyl group could decrease QED.
   - **Modify the Amine Group**: Converting the primary amine to a secondary or tertiary amine could have an impact.

6. **Select the Top Modification**: Based on the above considerations, replacing the hydroxyl group with a bulkier group like a tert-butyl group is the best option. This should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the chiral carbon with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To address the task, let's first analyze the requirements and previous attempts:

1. **Objective**: Decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Previous Attempts**: The previous attempts did not achieve the desired QED decrease, as the QED remained unchanged at 0.835.
3. **Action Space**: We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups to achieve the goal.

**Reasoning**:
- The molecule contains a thioether group (C-S), an aromatic ring, and an amide group connected to a bicyclic system.
- To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are less drug-like, such as larger hydrophobic groups, less polar functional groups, or increased rigidity.
- Since the previous modifications did not change the QED, we need to modify a part of the molecule that has a significant impact on the QED calculation, such as the amide group or the bicyclic system.

**Suggested Action**:
Replace the amide group with a less polar and more hydrophobic functional group, such as an ether group, to decrease the QED. This modification will reduce the polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, making the molecule less drug-like.

final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ether group in the molecule to decrease QED."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the molecule to make it "less like a drug" and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should still be similar to the original one.

2. **Previous Experience**: From the previous modifications, we observed that adding a methyl group (C(C)(C)C) to the molecule increased the QED, which is the opposite of our goal. Replacing the hydroxyl group with a chlorine atom (Cl) or a methoxy group (OC) also did not achieve the desired QED decrease. Removing the hydroxyl group (CCC(O)C1) was another attempt, but it did not significantly lower the QED. Additionally, changing the stereochemistry ([C@H] to [C@@H]) did not help in decreasing the QED.

3. **Strategy**:
   - To decrease the QED, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as adding bulky groups, increasing hydrophobicity, or reducing hydrogen bonding potential.
   - The modifications should maintain the overall structure and similarity to the original molecule.

4. **Modification Plan**:
   - **Replace the hydroxyl group with a larger, hydrophobic group**: This will reduce hydrogen bonding potential and make the molecule less drug-like. For example, replacing the hydroxyl group with a phenyl group could be effective.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group in the cyclopentane ring with a phenyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the molecule while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness. From the previous attempts, we observe that replacing the hydroxyl group in the cyclopentane ring with a phenyl group increased the QED, which is contrary to our goal. Therefore, we should avoid similar modifications that might increase QED. 

Instead, we should consider modifications that introduce less favorable drug-like properties, such as adding bulky or hydrophobic groups, or removing polar groups. Given that the previous modifications involving the cyclopentane ring were not effective, we should consider modifying other parts of the molecule, such as the ester group or the secondary amine.

Here is a suggestion that could help achieve the goal:

- **Replace the ethyl group attached to the ester with a larger, more hydrophobic group like a tert-butyl group.** This modification will increase the hydrophobicity and steric bulk, likely decreasing the QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ethyl group attached to the ester with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule `O=C(Nc1ccccc1-n1cccn1)c1ccc(Br)s1` to make it "less like a drug" by decreasing its QED value (which is currently 0.7791484551171418). The QED decrease should be more than 0, and the modified molecule should still be similar to the original.

2. **Previous Attempts**: In the previous suggestions, the sulfur atom (S) in the thiophene ring was replaced with oxygen (O), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), or another bromine (Br), but the QED of the resulting molecule `O=C(Nc1ccccc1-n1cccn1)c1ccc(Br)o1` increased to 0.7987591771457584. This indicates that simply replacing the sulfur atom with other atoms did not achieve the desired QED decrease.

3. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we should consider adding or modifying functional groups in a way that increases molecular complexity, hydrophobicity, or introduces unfavorable drug-like properties. The modification should also preserve structural similarity to the original molecule.

4. **Possible Action**: Instead of replacing the sulfur atom, we can **add a bulky or hydrophobic group** to the thiophene ring. This could increase molecular weight and logP, which are factors that typically decrease QED. A logical choice is to add a **methyl group** to the thiophene ring, as it is a simple modification that increases hydrophobicity and complexity while maintaining structural similarity.

5. **Final Suggestion**: Based on the above reasoning, the top-1 suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a methyl group to the thiophene ring next to the bromine atom."]
```

This modification should decrease the QED while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the molecule `COc1ccc(NC(=O)Cn2nc(C)c(N)c2C)cn1` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the original.

2. **Analysis of Previous Attempts:**  
   - The previous modification involved changing the `NH2` group on the imidazole ring to `NH(C=O)` and `NH(C=O)CH3`, but the QED of the modified molecule (`COc1ccc(NC(=O)Cn2nc(C)c(NC)c2C)cn1`) increased slightly (from 0.8716 to 0.8732). This suggests that adding polar or hydrogen-bonding groups like amides may not effectively decrease QED.

3. **Strategy for Decreasing QED:**  
   - QED is influenced by molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, polar surface area, and rotatable bonds. To decrease QED, we can:
     - Increase molecular weight or logP (e.g., by adding hydrophobic groups).
     - Reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors or polar surface area.
     - Introduce sterically bulky groups to reduce drug-likeness.

4. **Specific Modification:**  
   - Replace the `NH2` group on the imidazole ring with a hydrophobic alkyl group (e.g., a methyl group). This will reduce hydrogen bonding capacity and increase logP, thereby decreasing QED.

5. **Similarity Consideration:**  
   - The modification is minimal, involving only the replacement of `NH2` with a `CH3` group, ensuring structural similarity.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amino group on the imidazole ring with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0, we need to consider modifications that disrupt drug-like properties while maintaining similarity to the original molecule. The previous attempts have shown that simple substitutions, such as replacing the amino group with a methyl group, did not decrease the QED sufficiently. Therefore, we need to explore more impactful modifications that could reduce the molecule's drug-likeness.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Previous Experience**: The previous modification replaced the amino group on the imidazole ring with a methyl group, which increased the QED rather than decreasing it. This suggests that adding or replacing with small, hydrophobic groups may not be effective.
   
2. **Structural Considerations**: To reduce QED, we should consider introducing bulkier or more polar groups that disrupt the molecule’s ability to resemble a drug. Additionally, modifying the core structure of the molecule could have a more significant impact on its drug-likeness.

3. **Similarity**: To maintain similarity, we should focus on modifying functional groups rather than altering the core scaffold extensively.

4. **Action Space**: We can consider adding or replacing functional groups that increase polarity or bulkiness, such as hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acids, or larger aromatic substituents.

### Suggested Modification:
Given the above reasoning, a suitable modification would be to replace the amino group on the imidazole ring with a hydroxyl group. This introduces polarity, which typically reduces drug-likeness and should decrease the QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amino group on the imidazole ring with a hydroxyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the molecule `O=C(CN1C(=O)CCC1=O)NCCc1ccccc1` to make it "less like a drug" by decreasing its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.783680205467401. The modified molecule should still be similar to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Attempts:** In the previous suggestions, modifications like adding a methyl group (`C`), methoxy group (`OC`), acetyl group (`C(C)=O`), carboxyl group (`C(=O)O`), and amino group (`N`) were tried. However, adding a methyl group increased the QED, which is contrary to the goal.

3. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular weight, introducing bulky groups, or adding polar groups that do not contribute to drug-likeness. We should avoid adding groups that are commonly found in drugs, such as methyl, hydroxyl, or amino groups.

4. **Modification Idea:** Introducing a bulky, non-polar group like a phenyl ring (`c1ccccc1`) or a long aliphatic chain could reduce the drug-likeness by increasing the size and hydrophobicity of the molecule without introducing favorable drug-like properties.

5. **Similarity Consideration:** The modification should still resemble the original molecule, so we will focus on adding groups that do not drastically alter the core structure.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a phenyl ring to the nitrogen atom in the ethyl chain (NCCc1ccccc1)."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule "CCCC(=O)Nc1cccc[n+]1Cc1ccccc1" less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0, we need to consider modifications that typically reduce drug-likeness. These modifications might include introducing bulky or non-polar groups, adding halogens, or making the molecule more complex.

From the previous attempts, adding halogens like chlorine, bromine, fluorine, or iodine increased the QED instead of decreasing it. Therefore, halogen addition is not suitable for this task. Instead, we could consider adding a non-polar or bulky group that does not directly enhance drug-likeness.

One effective strategy could be to introduce a long alkyl chain, which increases hydrophobicity and complexity, thereby reducing the QED. This approach aligns with the goal of reducing drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

**Final reasoning:** Add a long alkyl chain (e.g., hexyl) to the molecule to increase hydrophobicity and complexity, reducing the QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hexyl group to the molecule to increase hydrophobicity and complexity."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**
1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.7156813097788347, while keeping it structurally similar to the original molecule.
2. **Previous Experience:** In the previous attempt, modifications were made to the alkyl chain (e.g., changing the length or branching of the chain). However, these changes did not significantly decrease the QED.
3. **Strategy:** To achieve a greater decrease in QED, we need to consider more drastic changes, such as introducing or modifying functional groups that are less favorable in drug-like molecules (e.g., large hydrophobic groups, polar groups that disrupt drug-likeness).
4. **Similarity Consideration:** The modification should preserve the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity while altering specific functional groups.
5. **Avoid Repetition:** The suggestion should not repeat the previous attempts, which focused on modifying the alkyl chain.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (C(=O)N) with an ester group (C(=O)O) in the molecule."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0, we need to consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties of the molecule while maintaining its overall similarity. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups. To decrease the QED, we can introduce modifications that increase the molecular weight, reduce polarity, or make the molecule less lipophilic.

Given the previous messages and the fact that the QED did not change significantly in the previous suggestions, we need a more impactful modification. One potential strategy is to introduce a bulky, non-polar group to the molecule, which could decrease the QED by increasing the molecular weight and reducing polarity.

**Reasoning Process:**
1. **Maintain Similarity:** The modification should be made to a part of the molecule that doesn’t significantly alter its core structure.
2. **Disrupt Drug-like Properties:** Introducing a bulky, non-polar group can decrease drug-likeness.
3. **Increase Molecular Weight:** Adding a large substituent can increase the molecular weight, which can lower the QED.
4. **Avoid Repetition:** Ensure the suggestion is different from previous modifications.

**Final Suggestion:**
- Replace the cyano group (C#N) with a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

This modification introduces a bulky, non-polar group, which should decrease the QED while maintaining the overall structure of the molecule.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the cyano group with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To address the task, let's carefully analyze the requirements and constraints:

### **Reasoning Process:**
1. **Goal:** Modify the molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should still retain structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Previous Attempts:** The previous attempts involved replacing the cyano group with a tert-butyl group, which increased the QED instead of decreasing it. This suggests that introducing bulky groups like tert-butyl is not effective for reducing QED.
3. **QED Considerations:** QED is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we should aim to increase molecular weight, increase logP, reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or increase polar surface area.
4. **Structural Similarity:** The modification should retain the core structure of the molecule, including the cyclic and stereochemical features.

### **Suggestion:**
To reduce QED while maintaining structural similarity, we can **replace the cyano group with a less polar and bulkier group** that does not introduce hydrogen bond donors or acceptors. A suitable candidate is a **phenyl group**, which is bulkier, less polar, and has no hydrogen bond donors/acceptors. This modification is expected to increase logP and molecular weight, thereby decreasing QED.

### **Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the cyano group with a phenyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0, while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce features typically not favorable in drug-like molecules. 

From the previous experience, we observed that adding a methyl group (C) to the oxygen atom in the last ring increased the QED, which is contrary to our goal. Therefore, we should avoid modifications that increase molecular weight and lipophilicity, as these tend to increase QED.

To decrease QED, we can consider:
- Introducing polar groups that reduce lipophilicity but are not typically found in drug-like molecules.
- Adding bulky groups that might disrupt the molecule's drug-like properties.
- Introducing electronegative atoms or groups that reduce the molecule's overall drug-likeness.

Given the previous suggestion added a methyl group to the oxygen, we can try replacing the oxygen in the last ring with a sulfur atom (thioether), which is less common in drug-like molecules and may decrease QED.

**Reasoning:**
1. Replacing oxygen with sulfur introduces a less common functional group in drugs.
2. Sulfur is larger and more polarizable than oxygen, which may reduce the molecule's drug-likeness.
3. This modification maintains structural similarity to the original molecule.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the oxygen atom in the last ring with a sulfur atom."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0, we need to consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule. Based on the previous attempts, replacing the oxygen atom with a sulfur atom did not achieve the desired QED decrease, indicating that other types of modifications may be more effective.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Learning from Previous Attempts**: The previous attempt involved replacing the oxygen atom in the last ring with a sulfur atom, which increased the QED. This suggests that modifying atoms in the ring system may not be the most effective strategy for decreasing QED.
2. **Functional Group Modification**: Since modifying the oxygen atom was not effective, we should consider modifying other functional groups in the molecule, such as the amide group.
3. **Maintaining Similarity**: To maintain similarity to the original molecule, we should avoid making drastic changes to the core structure or large functional groups.

Given these considerations, the modification strategy should focus on altering functional groups that contribute to the drug-like properties of the molecule, such as the amide group, which is often associated with drug-likeness.

### Suggested Modification:
Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a less drug-like functional group, such as an ester group (OC(=O)), to disrupt the drug-like properties and potentially decrease the QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with an ester group (OC(=O)) in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's carefully analyze the task and guidelines step-by-step:

**Analysis:**
1. **Goal:** Modify the molecule to make it less "drug-like" by decreasing QED (>0.7972196823286852) while maintaining similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Previous Attempt:** The previous suggestion involved replacing the sulfonamide group with a carboxamide group, which slightly increased QED (0.7977520568114801). This indicates that carboxamide might increase drug-likeness.
3. **Action Space:** Add, delete, or replace atoms/functional groups.
4. **Constraints:** Avoid repeating previous suggestions, maintain similarity, and ensure QED decreases.

**Reasoning:**
- To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that reduce drug-likeness, such as adding polar groups, increasing molecular weight, or reducing solubility.
- The sulfonamide group is a key feature; replacing it with a less drug-like group (e.g., ester or ether) could decrease QED.
- The molecule includes a methoxy group (COc1ccc...) which can be modified to reduce drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion:**
To achieve the goal, I suggest replacing the sulfonamide group (`S(=O)(=O)`) with an ester group (`COO`), which is less drug-like and can decrease QED. This modification maintains structural similarity while altering the functional group to reduce drug-likeness.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonamide group (S=O=O) with an ester group (COO) in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: Decrease the QED by modifying the molecule while maintaining its structural similarity. The starting QED is 0.5421173488681744, and the goal is to reduce it by more than 0.
2. **Previous Attempts**: The previous suggestions involved replacing the fluorine atom with other halogens or functional groups (Cl, Br, I, CF3), but these modifications did not change the QED value. This suggests that halogens or small functional groups may not sufficiently impact the QED.
3. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-likeness, such as adding bulky or non-drug-like groups, increasing molecular weight, or introducing less common functional groups.
4. **Similarity Constraint**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule, particularly the aromatic rings and the sulfonamide groups.
5. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group. Since deleting atoms may disrupt the core structure, adding or replacing groups is more appropriate.

### Suggested Modification:
Replace the fluorine atom on the benzene ring with a larger, less drug-like group, such as a phenyl group. This addition increases the molecular weight and introduces a bulky, hydrophobic moiety that reduces drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluorine atom on the benzene ring with a phenyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the problem and think step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule `CCS(=O)(=O)N[C@@H](c1ccccc1)[C@@H](C)C(=O)OC` to make it less drug-like by decreasing its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain similar to the original.

2. **Previous Attempt Analysis**:
   - The previous modification involved changing the ester group (`OC`) to a carboxylic acid group (`O`), but this actually increased the QED from 0.803 to 0.819, which is counterproductive.
   - The other modifications involved adding bulky groups like `C(C)(C)C`, `OCC`, etc., but none of these significantly reduced the QED.

3. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups.

4. **Strategy**:
   - To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are generally unfavorable in drug-like molecules, such as increased molecular weight, higher hydrophobicity, or steric hindrance.
   - Since previous attempts to add bulkier groups did not significantly reduce QED, we should consider alternative modifications that increase hydrophobicity or introduce less common functional groups.

5. **Proposed Modification**:
   - **Replace the ester group (`OC`) with a thioester group (`SC`)**: Thioesters are less common in drug-like molecules and are more hydrophobic, which could decrease the QED.

6. **Similarity Consideration**:
   - Replacing the oxygen in the ester with sulfur maintains the overall structure and functional group type (ester vs. thioester), ensuring structural similarity while introducing a less drug-like feature.

**Final Suggestion**:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ester group with a thioester group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0, we need to consider modifications that introduce functional groups or structural changes that are less drug-like. From the previous attempts, replacing the ester group with a thioester group increased the QED, which is counterproductive. Therefore, we need to explore other modifications.

**Reasoning Process:**

1. **Learning from Previous Attempts:** 
   - Replacing the ester with a thioester increased the QED, so we need to avoid this modification.
   - Modifications that increase molecular complexity or introduce bulky groups tend to decrease drug-likeness and QED.

2. **Identifying Substructure for Modification:**
   - The ester group (C(=O)OC) has been the focus of previous modifications. Instead of trying to modify the ester again, we can consider modifying other parts of the molecule, such as the phenyl ring or the central carbon chain.

3. **Exploring New Modifications:**
   - Adding a bulky or polar group to the phenyl ring could decrease drug-likeness.
   - Introducing a halogen or a group like a nitro group could also decrease QED.

4. **Ensuring Similarity:**
   - The modification should retain the core structure to ensure similarity while introducing changes that reduce drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the phenyl ring of the molecule to decrease drug-likeness and lower the QED."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule. From the previous experience, replacing the hydroxyl group with a halogen (Cl, F, Br, I) increased the QED, which is the opposite of what we want. Therefore, we should avoid such modifications.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should be minimal and focus on functional groups or atoms that are less likely to disrupt the overall structure of the molecule.
2. **Decreasing QED**: To decrease QED, we should introduce features that are less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as increased hydrophobicity, larger molecular size, or less favorable hydrogen bonding.
3. **Avoid Repeating Previous Modifications**: Since replacing the hydroxyl group with halogens increased QED, we need to explore other modifications.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Add a methyl group** to the aromatic ring (the pyridine ring) to increase hydrophobicity and molecular size, which typically decreases QED. This modification should not drastically alter the overall structure of the molecule.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a methyl group to the aromatic ring (pyridine ring) of the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the molecule to make it "less like a drug" and decrease its QED by at least 0.0, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Previous Attempts**: Previous modifications included adding a methyl group to the aromatic ring, which **increased** the QED (undesirable). This suggests that adding hydrophobic groups like methyl may not be the right approach.
3. **QED Considerations**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors like molecular weight, LogP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can increase molecular weight, add polar groups, or introduce less drug-like features.
4. **Similarity Constraint**: The modification should retain the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.
5. **Action Space**: Based on the action space (add, delete, or replace an atom/functional group), we should avoid adding hydrophobic groups and focus on adding polar or bulky groups that are less drug-like.

### Strategy:
- **Add a Polar Group**: Adding a polar group (e.g., hydroxyl, carboxyl) can increase polarity and decrease QED.
- **Add a Bulky Group**: Introducing a bulky group (e.g., tert-butyl) can decrease drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to the aliphatic chain of the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To address the task, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The goal is to modify the molecule `OC[C@@H]1O[C@H](Oc2c[nH]c3ccccc23)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O` to make it less like a drug by decreasing its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0. The modified molecule should still be similar to the original structure.

2. **Analyzing Previous Attempts**: In the previous attempts, modifications included adding an ester group (`OC(C)=O`) and replacing a hydroxyl group with an amino group (`N`). These changes either increased or minimally affected the QED, not achieving the desired decrease.

3. **Identifying Strategies to Decrease QED**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are less drug-like. This could involve:
   - Adding bulky or hydrophobic groups, which are less favorable in drug-like molecules.
   - Increasing molecular weight or complexity in ways that do not enhance drug-like properties.
   - Introducing less polar or more rigid structures.

4. **Focusing on Similarity**: We need to ensure that the modifications keep the molecule structurally similar to the original. This means targeting positions that are not critical to the core structure.

5. **Proposing a Modification**: Based on the above, a suitable modification would be to replace a hydroxyl group with a larger, less polar group, such as a phenyl group, to decrease QED while maintaining similarity.

**Reasoning Process**:
- **Target Site**: Select a hydroxyl group that is not directly involved in key hydrogen bonding or chiral centers.
- **Modification**: Replace the hydroxyl group with a phenyl group, which is more hydrophobic and less drug-like. This will increase the molecular weight and decrease polarity, reducing the QED.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydroxyl group on the sugar ring with a phenyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective Analysis**: The goal is to modify the molecule `OC[C@@H]1O[C@H](Oc2c[nH]c3ccccc23)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0. The previous modifications, particularly replacing a hydroxyl group with a phenyl group, increased the QED, which is contrary to the desired outcome.

2. **Learning from Previous Attempts**: Replacing a hydroxyl group with a phenyl group increased QED (from 0.5137 to 0.5722). This suggests that introducing aromatic rings or lipophilic groups may increase QED, as they enhance drug-likeness. Therefore, to decrease QED, we should avoid such modifications and instead consider introducing non-aromatic, bulkier, or less favorable functional groups.

3. **Action Space Consideration**: The action space allows adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups. Given the previous failure, we should focus on replacing a hydroxyl group with a less drug-like group, such as a bulkier or less polar group.

4. **Maintaining Similarity**: To ensure the molecule remains similar to the input, the modification should focus on a single functional group replacement rather than extensive changes to the structure.

5. **Suggested Modification**: Replace one of the hydroxyl groups on the sugar ring with a methyl group. Methyl groups are less polar and can decrease QED by reducing hydrogen bonding potential and increasing lipophilicity moderately, without significantly altering the overall structure.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the hydroxyl groups on the sugar ring with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: To make the molecule less drug-like and decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.4588165440730173 (the root QED value). The modified molecule should retain a similar structure to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Experience**: In the previous attempt, the nitro group (`[N+](=O)[O-]`) was replaced with various substituents like hydroxyl, methyl, methoxy, amino, and fluorine. However, the QED of the resulting molecule (0.7467979905030485) increased, which is contrary to the goal. This suggests that replacing the nitro group with simpler groups may not effectively decrease QED.

3. **Substructure Change**: Since the nitro group is a highly polar and electron-withdrawing group, replacing it with less polar or more complex groups could help decrease QED. Additionally, modifying other parts of the molecule, such as the sulfonamide group or the aromatic ring, could also achieve the desired effect.

4. **Action Space**: The task involves adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups. Given the previous failure in decreasing QED by modifying the nitro group, I will consider modifying other parts of the molecule.

5. **Similarity**: The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the input molecule. Thus, any changes should be localized and minimal to retain the overall structure.

6. **Suggestion**: Replace the sulfonamide group (`S(=O)(=O)`) with a less polar and less complex group, such as a methylene group (`CH2`). This modification should decrease the polarity and complexity of the molecule, thereby reducing its QED.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonamide group with a methylene group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task and think step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Decrease the QED of the molecule `C[C@@H](Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl)C(=O)N1CCN(S(=O)(=O)c2cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c2)CC1` by at least a threshold (which is "more than 0" based on the $threshold). The QED of the root molecule is 0.4588165440730173, and we need to make it less drug-like.

2. **Previous Experience**: 
   - The user requested to replace the sulfonamide group with a methylene group. However, the QED of the resulting molecule `C[C@@H](Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl)C(=O)N1CCCc2cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c2CC1` increased to 0.5099424314936349, which is the opposite of the goal. This suggests that removing the sulfonamide group is not the right direction.
   - From earlier attempts, modifying the nitro group or substituting it with other groups (e.g., hydroxyl, methyl, methoxy, amino, or fluorine) did not achieve the desired QED reduction. This indicates that other parts of the molecule need to be targeted.

3. **Similarity Consideration**: 
   - The output molecule should remain structurally similar to the input molecule. This means we should avoid drastic changes to the core structure (e.g., preserving the chiral center, the aromatic rings, and the amide bond).

4. **Insight for QED Reduction**:
   - QED decreases with properties like increased molecular weight, higher hydrophobicity, or the presence of non-drug-like features.
   - Targeting the amide bond or the chlorine substituents could achieve a reduction in QED while maintaining similarity.

5. **Action Space**:
   - Replace the amide bond with a non-polar, bulkier group to reduce drug-likeness.
   - Replace one or both chlorine atoms with larger, hydrophobic groups.

6. **Final Suggestion**:
   - Focus on replacing the amide bond with a non-polar group, as this is likely to reduce QED without drastically altering the core structure.

Here is the top-1 suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide bond (C(=O)N) with an ester group (C(=O)O) to decrease drug-likeness and lower QED."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the molecule `C[C@H]1CN(Cc2nc(CCc3ccccc3)no2)[C@H](C)CO1` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0. The output molecule should remain structurally similar to the original.
2. **Previous Attempts**: In the previous suggestions, modifications were made to the oxygen-containing ring (e.g., changing `CO1` to `COC1`), but these changes did not significantly decrease the QED. This indicates that modifications to the ring structure alone may not be sufficient.
3. **Strategy**: To further decrease the QED, we need to introduce changes that reduce drug-likeness. One effective way is to add bulky or polar groups that disrupt the molecule's drug-like properties while maintaining its structural core.
4. **Action Space**: Considering the guidelines, we should focus on adding or replacing functional groups rather than deleting atoms, as deletions might drastically alter the molecule's similarity.
5. **Similarity Consideration**: Adding a functional group to a less critical part of the molecule (e.g., the benzene ring) can reduce drug-likeness while preserving the core structure.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the benzene ring in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to make the molecule less like a drug by decreasing its QED by at least 0. The molecule should remain structurally similar to the original.
2. **Previous Experience**: From the previous attempt, replacing the ammonium group ([NH3+]) with a methyl group (C) increased the QED from 0.752 to 0.803, which is the opposite of what we want. This indicates that replacing [NH3+] with a less polar or less charged group might not be the right strategy.
3. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we should consider introducing modifications that increase molecular complexity, reduce drug-likeness, or introduce unfavorable features such as larger size, more rotatable bonds, or less favorable polarity.
4. **Modification Suggestion**: Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a less favorable functional group like an ester or a less polar group, which could decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

5. **Final Suggestion**: Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with an ester group (OC(=O)).

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the molecule `CCOC[C@H]1CCN(C(=O)/C=C/c2ccc(OCC#N)cc2)C1` to make it less like a drug, while decreasing its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should retain structural similarity to the original.

2. **Previous Experience:** The previous modifications in `$previous_messages` involved changing the `OCC#N` group to simpler substituents like `OC`, `O`, `OCC`, `OCCO`, and `OC(C)=O`. However, the QED of the first candidate (`CCOC[C@H]1CCN(C(=O)/C=C/c2ccc(OC)cc2)C1`) **increased** to 0.7556, which is contrary to the goal. This suggests that replacing the `OCC#N` group with simpler alkyl or alkoxy groups may not be effective in decreasing QED.

3. **Action Space:** To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are less drug-like. This could involve:
   - Adding bulkier or less polar groups.
   - Removing or modifying functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness.
   - Introducing steric hindrance or less favorable physicochemical properties.

4. **Key Insight:** The `OCC#N` group is a nitrile-containing alkoxy group, which is relatively polar and contributes to drug-likeness. Replacing it with a less polar or bulkier group could decrease QED.

5. **Proposed Modification:** **Replace the `OCC#N` group with a bulkier, less polar aryl group** (e.g., a phenyl ring). This introduces steric hindrance and reduces polarity, which should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

6. **Similarity Consideration:** The phenyl ring is a common structural motif in drug-like molecules, so replacing `OCC#N` with a phenyl ring will retain some similarity while reducing drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ethoxy nitrile group (OCC#N) with a phenyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.7575438784352314, we need to consider modifying functional groups or atoms that contribute to drug-like properties. From the previous suggestions, we observe that modifications were made to the nitrogen-containing groups and the carbon chain. However, none of these changes successfully decreased the QED. 

To further decrease the QED, we could consider the following strategy:
1. **Increase the molecular weight**: Introducing larger, bulkier groups that are not typically found in drugs could decrease the QED.
2. **Modify the nitrogen-containing groups**: Since nitrogen-containing groups often contribute to drug-like properties, altering them to non-polar or less polar groups could reduce the QED.

Based on these considerations, the top suggestion would be:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the protonated nitrogen group with a non-polar, bulky group such as a tert-butyl group to decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity."]
```

This suggestion aims to decrease the QED by introducing a bulky, non-polar group, which is expected to make the molecule less drug-like while maintaining some structural similarity to the original molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the molecule while maintaining structural similarity, let’s carefully analyze the previous attempts and the guidelines provided:

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Previous Attempts**:
   - In previous suggestions, replacing the protonated nitrogen group with a non-polar, bulky group (e.g., tert-butyl) was tried, but this increased the QED instead of decreasing it. This indicates that non-polar, bulky groups might not be the most effective strategy for reducing QED in this context.
2. **QED Considerations**:
   - QED is influenced by factors like molecular weight, lipophilicity, polarity, and the presence of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors. To decrease QED, we could introduce less drug-like features, such as larger, more polar, or more complex groups that disrupt the molecule’s drug-likeness.
3. **Structural Similarity**:
   - The modifications should maintain the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity to the input molecule. This means targeting peripheral or functional groups rather than altering the core scaffold.
4. **Action Space**:
   - Based on the previous results, replacing specific functional groups with less drug-like counterparts (e.g., polar or sterically hindered groups) could be a viable strategy.

### Potential Strategy:
- Replace the morpholine ring (N2CCOCC2) with a less drug-like, bulkier, and more polar group. This should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the morpholine ring (N2CCOCC2) with a piperidine ring containing a hydroxyl group at the 4-position."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to make the molecule "C=CCNS(=O)(=O)c1cccnc1Cl" less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should retain similarity to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Experience:** In the previous attempt, replacing the chlorine atom (Cl) with a methyl group (C) or other halogens did not achieve the desired QED decrease. In fact, the QED increased in the case of C=CCNS(=O)(=O)c1cccnc1C (QED: 0.7527768293675068). This suggests that replacing the chlorine with smaller or similar-sized groups may not be effective for decreasing QED.

3. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. This could involve:
   - Adding bulkier or more polar groups that decrease the overall drug-likeness.
   - Removing or replacing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness.

4. **Similarity Consideration:** The modification should not drastically alter the structure to maintain similarity. Focusing on the aromatic ring or the sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) could be effective, as they are key features of the molecule.

5. **Suggested Action:**
   Replace the sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) with a more bulky and less polar group, such as an ester group (COO). This modification is likely to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) with an ester group (COO)."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to make the molecule less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The output molecule should remain similar to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Experience**: The previous modifications (e.g., adding a methyl group) did not decrease the QED significantly. In fact, the QED increased slightly in one case. Therefore, we need to try different modifications that are likely to reduce the QED.

3. **Possible Modifications**:
   - **Add a bulky group**: Adding a bulky group can reduce the drug-likeness by increasing steric hindrance, which could lower QED.
   - **Remove a polar group**: Removing a polar group like an amide can reduce the drug-likeness since hydrogen bonding is a key feature of many drugs.
   - **Replace a polar group with a non-polar group**: This can reduce the molecule's solubility and hydrogen bonding potential, decreasing QED.

4. **Similarity Consideration**: To maintain similarity, the modification should be localized and not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule.

5. **Final Suggestion**: Replace the amide group (`C(=O)N`) with a less polar group like an ester (`C(=O)O`) to reduce hydrogen bonding potential and drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (C(=O)N) with an ester group (C(=O)O) at the position where it connects to the aromatic ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The objective is to modify the molecule to make it **less drug-like** and **decrease QED by at least 0.721860581925294**, while keeping it structurally similar to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Experience**: The previous modifications involved replacing the amide group with an ester group, which **increased QED**. This suggests that replacing or modifying functional groups that reduce polarity or hydrogen bonding potential might not be effective. Instead, we need to consider **adding bulky or hydrophobic groups** or **disrupting key interactions** that contribute to drug-likeness.

3. **Avoid Repetition**: The previous suggestions focused on functional group replacement. To avoid repetition, we should consider **adding or deleting atoms/groups** rather than just replacing them.

4. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule (e.g., the morpholine ring and aromatic system) while introducing changes that reduce QED.

5. **Suggested Action**: Add a bulky and hydrophobic group (e.g., tert-butyl) to the molecule. This will disrupt interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding) and increase molecular weight, reducing QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a tert-butyl group to the nitrogen of the morpholine ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the molecule O[C@H](C[NH2+]C[C@H]1COc2ccccc21)C1CC1 by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to consider modifications that reduce drug-likeness. From the previous experience, adding halogen atoms (e.g., Br, Cl, F) increased the QED, which is contrary to our goal. Therefore, we should explore other modifications that are less likely to increase drug-likeness.

Potential strategies to decrease QED include:
1. **Introducing bulky or less common functional groups**: These groups can reduce the molecule's drug-likeness by increasing steric hindrance or making the structure less favorable for drug-like properties.
2. **Replacing polar groups with less polar or hydrophobic groups**: This can decrease the molecule's solubility and overall drug-likeness.
3. **Introducing groups that disrupt aromaticity or conjugation**: This can reduce the molecule's stability and drug-likeness.

Considering the similarity constraint, we should focus on modifications that do not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule.

**Reasoning Process**:
- The previous attempt to add a bromine atom (Br) to the aromatic ring increased the QED, which is not desired.
- Therefore, we should avoid adding halogens to the aromatic ring or other parts of the molecule.
- Instead, we can try replacing a hydrogen atom in the cyclopropane ring (C1CC1) with a bulky or less common group, such as a tert-butyl group, which is known to reduce drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom in the cyclopropane ring with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: We need to make the molecule less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.778959218611841. The modified molecule should still be similar to the original one.

2. **Previous Attempts**: Previous modifications involved adding a bromine atom, a tert-butyl group, or other substituents to the cyclopropane ring or the aromatic ring. However, the tert-butyl addition increased the QED, which is counterproductive.

3. **Learning from Experience**: The tert-butyl group, being bulky and hydrophobic, increased the QED, likely due to an increase in molecular weight and lipophilicity. Therefore, we should avoid adding large, hydrophobic groups.

4. **Possible Actions**: To decrease QED, we should consider adding polar or hydrophilic groups, or introducing steric hindrance that disrupts drug-like properties without increasing lipophilicity.

5. **Suggested Modification**: Replace a hydrogen atom on the cyclopropane ring with a hydroxyl group. This will increase polarity and could decrease QED by disrupting drug-like properties.

6. **Similarity Consideration**: Adding a hydroxyl group is a minor modification that maintains the core structure of the molecule, ensuring similarity.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the cyclopropane ring with a hydroxyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The task is to modify the given molecule to make it less like a drug by decreasing the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0. The modified molecule should still be similar to the original molecule.

2. **Analyzing Previous Attempts**: The previous attempts involved modifications to the nitrogen-containing group (e.g., adding or modifying the quaternary ammonium group). However, these changes inadvertently increased the QED, which is counterproductive to the goal.

3. **Identifying Key Features for QED Reduction**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are less desirable in drug-like molecules, such as:
   - Increasing molecular weight beyond typical drug-like ranges.
   - Introducing polar groups that reduce membrane permeability.
   - Adding bulky groups that may hinder binding to biological targets.

4. **Considering Similarity**: The modifications should maintain structural similarity to the original molecule, so drastic changes that alter the core structure should be avoided.

5. **Targeting Specific Functional Groups**: The molecule contains a benzyl group, an amide group, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. Modifying these regions could help achieve the goal without losing similarity.

6. **Avoiding Previous Mistakes**: The previous attempts focused on the quaternary ammonium group, which increased QED. Instead, we should explore modifications to other parts of the molecule.

### Final Suggestion

Based on the reasoning above, the top suggestion is to **replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a bulkier and less drug-like sulfonamide group (N(=O)(=O))**. This modification introduces a polar and bulky group, which is likely to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a sulfonamide group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Reasoning process:
1. **Understanding the goal**: The objective is to modify the molecule to make it less drug-like by decreasing its QED by at least 0, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Analyzing previous results**: The previous modifications (removing or altering stereochemistry or ring structures) did not achieve the QED decrease, as the QED remained unchanged.
3. **Considering QED factors**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that deviate from these drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular weight, altering polarity, or introducing unfavorable functional groups.
4. **Ensuring similarity**: The modified molecule should retain the core structure of the input molecule, including the bicyclic system and key functional groups.
5. **Proposing a modification**: Adding a bulky, non-drug-like functional group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) to the molecule could decrease QED while maintaining similarity. This would increase molecular weight and logP, both of which are unfavorable for drug-likeness.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a tertiary butyl group to the aromatic ring of the input molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The task is to modify the molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.7669137240977267, while maintaining similarity to the original structure.

2. **Previous Experience:** In the previous attempt, modifications were made to the amine group (e.g., [NH3+] to [NH2]), which increased the QED instead of decreasing it. This suggests that altering functional groups that contribute positively to drug-likeness (e.g., amines) may not be effective in decreasing QED.

3. **Action Space:** To decrease QED, we should consider adding or replacing functional groups that are typically less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as large hydrophobic groups, polar but non-H-bonding groups, or groups that increase molecular weight or complexity.

4. **Similarity Consideration:** The modification should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

5. **Strategy:** Replace a functional group with a less drug-like alternative, such as adding a bulky alkyl group or a polar but non-H-bonding group.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group with a large alkyl group, such as a tert-butyl group, to decrease QED."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The objective is to modify the molecule `C[C@@]12CC3CC(N4CC[C@H]([NH3+])C4=O)(C1)C[C@](C)(C3)C2` to decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0. while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **History:** Previous attempts involved replacing the carbonyl group with various alkyl groups, but this resulted in an **increase** in QED (e.g., the QED of `C[C@@]12CC3CC(N4CC[C@H]([NH3+])C4C(C)(C)C)(C1)C[C@](C)(C3)C2` was **0.7899451017724538**, which is higher than the root molecule's QED of **0.7669137240977267**).

3. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-likeness. Common strategies include:
   - Adding bulky or non-polar groups (e.g., large alkyl or aromatic groups).
   - Removing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups.
   - Introducing steric hindrance or reducing solubility.

4. **Action Space:** Based on the molecule's structure, a promising approach is to modify the **amine group (NH3+)** since it is a highly polar and charged moiety, contributing significantly to drug-likeness. Replacing it with a less polar or bulky group can decrease QED.

5. **Similarity Consideration:** To maintain structural similarity, the modification should keep the core ring structure intact and only alter the amine group.

6. **Avoiding Previous Suggestions:** Previous attempts focused on modifying the carbonyl group, so this time we target the amine group.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the positively charged amine group with a bulky and non-polar tert-butyl group to decrease polarity and drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule to make it less like a drug by decreasing its QED by at least 0.533300775377087 while maintaining similarity to the original structure.

2. **Constraints**: 
   - The modified molecule should be similar to the original molecule.
   - The QED should decrease by at least the specified threshold.
   - The suggestions should not repeat the previous modifications (e.g., replacing `=O` with `OH` or adding `CC`).
   - The suggestions should be specific and avoid abbreviations.

3. **Analysis of Previous Suggestions**:
   - Previous attempts involved adding or replacing functional groups like `=O` with `OH`, adding `CC`, or inserting `OC`.
   - These modifications did not significantly decrease the QED below the threshold.

4. **Strategy**:
   - To further decrease QED, we can consider adding or replacing bulky, less drug-like functional groups.
   - The modifications should be subtle to maintain similarity but impactful enough to reduce QED.

5. **Suggested Modification**:
   - Add a `sulfonyl group` to a nitrogen atom in the molecule. Sulfonyl groups are bulky and less common in drug-like molecules, which could reduce QED while maintaining some structural similarity.

**Reasoning**: Adding a sulfonyl group increases the molecular weight and adds a polar group, which are characteristics that typically reduce QED. This modification is also distinct from previous attempts.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a sulfonyl group to the nitrogen atom in the pyrrole ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal Understanding**: The task is to modify the molecule `Cc1cc(C)n(-c2ccc(N3CCC[C@H](C(=O)N=c4[nH]c5ccccc5[nH]4)C3)nn2)n1` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain similar to the original structure.
2. **Previous Attempt Analysis**: Previous modifications focused on adding a sulfonyl group to the nitrogen atom in the pyrrole ring. However, this increased the QED instead of decreasing it, moving away from the goal.
3. **Chemical Insights**: To decrease QED, modifications should introduce features that are typically unfavorable in drug-like molecules, such as increased hydrophobicity, bulkiness, or disruption of aromaticity.
4. **Action Space**: Based on the guidelines, the action space involves adding, deleting, or replacing an atom or functional group. The modification should avoid repeating previous attempts.
5. **Strategy**: To achieve the goal, introducing a bulky hydrophobic group or disrupting aromaticity in a way that reduces drug-likeness could be effective.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Replace the imine group (N=C) in the pyrrole ring with a less polar and bulky group** to disrupt the aromaticity and decrease the overall drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the imine group (N=C) in the pyrrole ring with a non-polar and bulky alkyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to make the molecule less drug-like by decreasing its QED by at least 0. We need to maintain structural similarity while achieving this.
2. **Previous Experience**: In the previous attempt, removing a methyl group from the phenyl ring increased the QED, which is the opposite of what we want. Therefore, we should avoid removing small groups like methyl.
3. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we can introduce atoms or functional groups that reduce drug-likeness, such as large or polar groups, or we can reduce the complexity of the molecule.
4. **Action**: Replace a small functional group with a larger or less drug-like group. For example, replacing a hydrogen or methyl group with a bulky or polar group can decrease QED.
5. **Similarity Consideration**: To maintain similarity, the modification should be localized and not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydrogen atom on the nitrogen in the hydrazone group with a nitro group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's reason through the task step by step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule `C[C@H]1C[NH+]2CCCC[C@@H]2CN1C(=O)NC[C@@H](C)C(=O)[O-]` to make it less like a drug by decreasing its QED by at least 0. The output molecule should remain structurally similar to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Attempts**: In the previous suggestion, the carboxylate group (C(=O)[O-]) was replaced with various functional groups, which increased the QED rather than decreasing it. This suggests that modifications to the carboxylate group may not be effective for decreasing QED.

3. **Key Insight**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, introducing less common functional groups, or reducing solubility. Modification of the amine or amide groups might be a better approach since they are common in drug-like molecules.

4. **Suggested Modification**: Replace the amide group (C(=O)NC) with a less drug-like functional group, such as an ester or a thioester. This change can decrease the QED while maintaining similarity to the original molecule.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (C(=O)NC) with an ester group (C(=O)O) in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The goal is to make the molecule less like a drug by decreasing its QED by at least 0. The output molecule should retain structural similarity to the input molecule.

2. **Previous Attempts**: Previous attempts included:
   - Modifying the carboxylate group to different functional groups (e.g., ester, amide, halide, etc.).
   - Replacing the amide group with an ester group, which unexpectedly increased the QED.

3. **Learning from Experience**: Since replacing the amide group with an ester group increased the QED, we should avoid similar modifications that might enhance drug-likeness. Instead, we should focus on modifications that reduce polarity, increase steric hindrance, or disrupt favorable interactions that contribute to drug-likeness.

4. **Action Space**: The suggested modifications should involve adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups while maintaining structural similarity.

5. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule, particularly the cyclic amine and the adjacent functional groups.

6. **Proposed Modification**: To decrease QED, one effective strategy would be to **replace the carboxylate group with a less polar and less hydrogen-bonding functional group**. This can be achieved by replacing the carboxylate group with an alkyl group, which reduces polarity and disrupts hydrogen bonding, thereby decreasing drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carboxylate group with a methyl group to reduce polarity and disrupt hydrogen bonding."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to make the molecule less like a drug and decrease the QED value by at least 0. The QED of the root molecule is 0.5365860069890299, and the previous modification increased the QED to 0.6217956730261381, which is contrary to the desired outcome. Therefore, the next modification should aim to decrease the QED further.

2. **Previous Experience:** The previous modification involved altering the methoxy group (-OCH3) to a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the phenyl ring. This change increased the QED, suggesting that reducing polarity or removing polar groups might be ineffective in decreasing QED.

3. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we should consider adding bulky or non-polar groups, increasing molecular weight, or introducing less favorable physicochemical properties (e.g., increasing hydrophobicity or reducing solubility). 

4. **Similarity Consideration:** The modification should preserve the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity while targeting specific functional groups for change.

5. **Action Space:** Replace the oxygen atom in the methoxy group (-OCH3) with a larger, less polar substituent.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to the phenyl ring with a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the molecule \( \text{N#CC1(NC(=O)C2=NN(c3ccccc3)[C@@H](c3ccccc3)C2)CCCC1} \) to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0. The modified molecule should remain similar to the original structure.

2. **Previous Experience**: From the previous suggestions, it appears that modifying the aromatic rings (e.g., replacing a benzene ring with a heterocycle) did not effectively decrease the QED. In fact, the QED increased in the previous attempt.

3. **Action Space**: We need to consider actions that could reduce the drug-likeness without significantly altering the overall structure. Possible modifications could involve replacing functional groups or atoms that contribute to high QED values.

4. **Modification Strategy**: To decrease QED, we can consider adding or replacing functional groups that are less favorable in drug-like molecules. For example, introducing larger or more polar groups could reduce QED.

5. **Suggested Modification**: Replace the nitrile group (N#C) with a less drug-like group. The nitrile group is often associated with high QED due to its favorable properties in drug design. Replacing it with a functional group like a sulfonamide or a bulky ester could decrease the QED without drastically altering the overall structure.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitrile group with a sulfonamide group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.6222481939461765, we need to carefully modify the molecule while maintaining its overall structure. The previous attempts either did not decrease the QED sufficiently or increased it, indicating that the modifications need to be more strategic.

**Reasoning Process:**
1. **Learning from Previous Experience:** 
   - The previous modification removed the chiral center and replaced the positively charged amine with a neutral group, which increased the QED. This suggests that removing or neutralizing charged groups might not be the right approach.
   - The molecule should retain its core structure but incorporate changes that reduce drug-likeness.

2. **Key Modifications to Consider:**
   - **Add bulkier groups:** Adding bulkier groups can reduce the drug-likeness by increasing molecular weight and complexity.
   - **Introduce polar but non-drug-like functional groups:** Adding polar groups like aldehydes or nitriles can decrease QED.
   - **Remove or replace amide bonds:** Amide bonds are common in drugs, so replacing them with less common bonds could reduce drug-likeness.

3. **Specific Action:**
   - **Replace one of the amide groups with a nitrile group:** This change introduces a polar group that is less common in drug molecules, potentially decreasing the QED.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (C=O) adjacent to the cyclohexane ring (C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1) with a nitrile group (C≡N)."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: The goal is to modify the molecule `CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)[O-]` to make it "less like a drug" by decreasing its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0. QED is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can make the molecule less drug-like by increasing its molecular weight, reducing its solubility, or disrupting its hydrogen bonding capacity. Additionally, the modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the original.

From the previous attempts, adding ester groups (e.g., `OCC`, `OC(C)C`, `Oc1ccccc1`, etc.) increased the QED, which is counterproductive. Therefore, we need to avoid modifications that increase solubility or hydrogen bonding. Instead, we should focus on adding bulky, hydrophobic groups or disrupting the molecule's hydrogen bonding potential.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Avoid Adding Polar Groups**: Adding ester or hydroxyl groups increases QED, so we should avoid these modifications.
2. **Add Bulky, Hydrophobic Groups**: Introducing large, non-polar groups can decrease QED by increasing hydrophobicity and molecular weight.
3. **Disrupt Hydrogen Bonding**: Removing or modifying hydrogen bond donors/acceptors can lower QED.
4. **Maintain Similarity**: The modified molecule should retain the core structure, such as the pyridine ring, nitrile group, and carboxylate moiety.

### Suggested Modification:
Replace the negatively charged carboxylate group (`[O-]`) with a bulky, non-polar group like a tert-butyl group. This modification increases hydrophobicity and molecular weight, which should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carboxylate group with a tert-butyl group to increase hydrophobicity and decrease QED."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0, we need to consider modifications that increase hydrophobicity or introduce bulky groups, which tend to lower QED values. Based on the previous attempts, replacing the carboxylate group with a tert-butyl group did not achieve the desired decrease in QED. Therefore, we need to explore other modifications that could further decrease the QED while maintaining some similarity to the original molecule.

**Reasoning Process:**
1. **Previous Attempts**: Replacing the carboxylate group with a tert-butyl group increased QED, which is contrary to our goal. This suggests that simply increasing hydrophobicity may not be sufficient.
2. **Goal**: We need to decrease QED by at least 0 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule.
3. **Strategy**: Introducing larger, more complex groups or modifying the existing functional groups to reduce polarity and increase steric hindrance could help achieve the desired decrease in QED.
4. **Suggested Modification**: Replace the carboxylate group with a larger, more hydrophobic group like a phenyl ring (which is bulkier and less polar) to decrease QED.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carboxylate group with a phenyl ring to increase hydrophobicity and decrease QED."]
```

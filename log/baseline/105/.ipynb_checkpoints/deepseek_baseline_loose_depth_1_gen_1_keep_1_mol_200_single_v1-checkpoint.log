AI answer 0: To modify the molecule to potentially increase permeability and decrease tPSA, we can consider several strategies such as reducing polar surface area by minimizing or replacing polar groups, adding hydrophobic substituents, or altering the structure slightly to influence conformation and packing. Here are five modified molecules based on your starting point:

- C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1F)[S@@](=O)Cc1nn(C)nn1C1CC1: Introduced a methyl group on one of the nitrogens in the pyridine ring to increase hydrophobicity.
- C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)c(F)c1)[S@@](=O)Cc1nnnn1C1CC1: Replaced one of the carbon-carbon bonds with a fluorine-carbon bond to reduce overall polarity.
- C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1F)[S@@](=O)Cc1nnnn1C1CC1: Swapped one of the fluorines for a chlorine to adjust electronic effects while maintaining hydrophobicity.
- C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1)[S@@](=O)Cc1nnnn1C1CC1: Removed one fluorine to decrease the number of polar atoms and potentially lower tPSA.
- C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1)[S@](=O)Cc1nnnn1C1CC1: Changed the sulfur chirality from [S@@] to [S@] which might influence the molecular shape and interactions without significantly changing the physicochemical properties.

AI answer 0: To improve the permeability and decrease the topological polar surface area (tPSA) of the molecule, we can consider several modifications. These include reducing polar functional groups or substituting with less polar alternatives, which can help in decreasing tPSA while maintaining structural similarity. Here are five modified molecules:

- **O=C1CN(c2ccc(NC(=O)c3cc(F)c(F)c3)cc2Cl)CCN1**: Removed one fluorine to reduce polarity.
- **O=C1CN(c2ccc(NC(=O)c3ccc(C)cc3)cc2Cl)CCN1**: Replaced one fluorine with a methyl group to decrease polarity.
- **O=C1CN(c2ccc(NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c3)cc2Cl)CCN1**: Replaced fluorines with chlorines, which are less electronegative and thus reduce polarity.
- **O=C1CN(c2ccc(NC(=O)c3ccc(F)c(F)c3)cc2C)CCN1**: Changed the chlorine to a methyl group to reduce polarity and tPSA.
- **O=C1CN(c2ccc(NC(=O)c3ccc(F)c(F)c3)cc2Br)CCN1**: Replaced chlorine with bromine, which is larger and less polarizable, potentially reducing tPSA.

Each of these modifications aims to reduce the overall polarity of the molecule, thereby potentially improving permeability and decreasing tPSA.

AI answer 0: To modify the given molecule to improve its permeability and decrease its topological polar surface area (tPSA), we can consider reducing the number of polar groups, particularly hydroxyl (-OH) groups and amide linkages, which contribute significantly to tPSA. Additionally, we can explore substituting these with less polar functionalities or altering the structure slightly to maintain similarity while achieving the desired properties.

Starting from the root molecule: `N#Cc1ccccc1NC(=O)CC[NH+]1C[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C1`, here are five new molecules that might have improved permeability and lower tPSA:

- `N#Cc1ccccc1NC(=O)CC[NH+]1C[C@H](F)[C@H](F)C1`: Replaced hydroxyl groups with fluorine atoms to reduce polarity.
- `N#Cc1ccccc1NC(=O)CC[NH+]1C[C@H](O)[C@@H](C)C1`: Introduced a methyl group instead of a second hydroxyl group to decrease tPSA.

AI answer 0: To improve the permeability and decrease the topological polar surface area (tPSA) of the molecule, we can make strategic modifications to reduce polar groups or increase hydrophobicity. Here are five modified molecules derived from your starting structure:

- **CCOC(=O)c1c(NC(=O)c2cc(=O)c3cc(C)cc(C)c3o2)sc(C)c1F**: Replaced one of the terminal carbon atoms with fluorine to increase lipophilicity and potentially reduce tPSA.

- **CCOC(=O)c1c(NC(=O)c2cc(=O)c3cc(C)cc(C)c3o2)sc(C)c1CC**: Extended the chain at the terminal position with an additional carbon, increasing hydrophobicity without adding polar surface area.
- **CCOC(=O)c1c(NC(=O)c2cc(=O)c3cc(C)cc(C)c3o2)sc(C)c1CN**: Introduced a nitrile group at the terminal position, which is less polar than oxygen-containing groups and can enhance lipophilicity.

AI answer 0: To increase the permeability and decrease the topological polar surface area (tPSA) of a molecule, one strategy is to reduce the number of polar groups or replace them with less polar alternatives. For the given molecule, we can focus on modifying the ether (-O-) and amide (-C(=O)N-) functionalities, as well as the phenyl groups that contain an ether linkage. Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format:

- C[C@H]1OCC[C@@H]1C(=O)NCc1cccc(CCc2ccccc2)c1
- C[C@H]1OCC[C@@H]1C(=O)NCc1cccc(CSCc2ccccc2)c1
- C[C@H]1OCC[C@@H]1C(=S)NCc1cccc(COCc2ccccc2)c1
- C[C@H]1OCC[C@@H]1C(=O)NCc1cccc(Cl)c1
- C[C@H]1OCC[C@@H]1C(=O)NCc1cccc(CFc2ccccc2)c1

These modifications aim to either reduce polarity by replacing oxygen atoms with sulfur (less polar), changing functional groups to less polar alternatives, or altering substituents on the aromatic ring to influence overall polarity and potentially improve permeability.

- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1ccc(C#N)c(Cl)c1)C(=O)OC: Introduced a chlorine atom on the aromatic ring and changed the terminal carboxylate to an ester to reduce polarity.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1ccc(C#N)c(Br)c1)C(=O)OC: Substituted a bromine atom on the aromatic ring and modified the terminal group to an ester to increase lipophilicity.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1ccc(C#N)c(I)c1)C(=O)OC: Added an iodine atom to the aromatic ring for increased lipophilicity and changed the carboxylate to an ester.

These modifications aim to balance the retention of structural similarity with improvements in permeability and reduction in tPSA.

AI answer 0: To improve the permeability and decrease the topological polar surface area (tPSA) of the molecule, we can consider modifications that reduce polar groups or increase hydrophobicity. Here are five modified molecules derived from your root_molecule:

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2Cl)cno1**: Removed one double bond to reduce polarity.
- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)cnc1**: Changed the oxygen in the nitro group to a nitrogen to slightly alter the electronic environment and reduce polarity.
- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2Cl)cn1**: Simplified the heterocyclic ring by changing the nitro group to an amine, reducing polarity.
- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)c1ccncc1**: Modified the heterocyclic ring structure to a benzene-like system with an amine, potentially reducing tPSA.
- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)c1cccnc1**: Altered the heterocyclic ring to include a thiazole-like structure, which might enhance hydrophobic interactions while reducing polar surface area.

These modifications aim to retain structural similarity while addressing the properties you want to optimize.

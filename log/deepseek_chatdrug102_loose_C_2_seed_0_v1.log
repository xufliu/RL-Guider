User:Can you make molecule CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]CC1 less soluble in water? The output molecule should be similar to the input molecule. Give me five molecules in SMILES only and list them using bullet points.
AI:Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format that are less soluble in water while remaining structurally similar to the input molecule:

- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]CC(C)C1**  
  (Added a methyl group to the cyclic amine)

- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]C(C)C1**  
  (Added a methyl group to the terminal amine)

- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]CC1C**  
  (Added a methyl group to the cyclic amine ring)

- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]C(CC)CC1**  
  (Extended the side chain with an ethyl group)

- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]C(C)(C)C1**  
  (Added two methyl groups to the terminal amine)

These modifications introduce hydrophobic groups or increase steric bulk, reducing water solubility while maintaining structural similarity.

User:Can you make molecule CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)[O-] less soluble in water? The output molecule should be similar to the input molecule. Give me five molecules in SMILES only and list them using bullet points.
AI:Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format that are designed to be less soluble in water while remaining structurally similar to the input molecule:

- **CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)Oc2ccccc2**  
  (Added a phenyl ester group to reduce water solubility)

- **CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)Oc(C)C**  
  (Added an isopropyl ester group to reduce water solubility)

- **CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)Oc1ccccc1C**  
  (Added a toluene ester group to reduce water solubility)

- **CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC**  
  (Added an anisole ester group to reduce water solubility)

- **CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)Oc1ccccc1Cl**  
  (Added a chlorophenyl ester group to reduce water solubility)

These modifications introduce hydrophobic groups (e.g., aromatic rings, alkyl chains) to decrease water solubility while maintaining structural similarity.

User:Can you make molecule Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)no1 less soluble in water? The output molecule should be similar to the input molecule. Give me five molecules in SMILES only and list them using bullet points.
AI:Here are five modified versions of the input molecule designed to be less soluble in water, while maintaining structural similarity. The modifications include adding hydrophobic groups or reducing polar functional groups:

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2C(C)C)no1**  
  (Added a tert-butyl group to increase hydrophobicity)  

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2OC(C)C)no1**  
  (Added an isopropyl ether group to reduce polarity)  

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2C=C)no1**  
  (Replaced a chlorine with a vinyl group to reduce polarity)  

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2C#C)no1**  
  (Replaced a chlorine with an alkyne group to reduce polarity)  

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2CC)no1**  
  (Replaced a chlorine with an ethyl group to increase hydrophobicity)  

These modifications aim to reduce water solubility while keeping the core structure intact.

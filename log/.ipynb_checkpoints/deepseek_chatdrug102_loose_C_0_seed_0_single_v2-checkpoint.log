User:Can you make molecule CCCCc1noc([C@H]2C=CC(=N)S2)n1 less soluble in water? We find a sequence CCCCNC(=O)c1sc(-c2cccs2)nc1C which is correct and similar to the input molecule.  Your output molecule should not be the same to the correct molecule. Give me five molecules in SMILES only and list them using bullet points.
AI:Here are five modified versions of the input molecule designed to be less soluble in water, with increased hydrophobicity or reduced polarity. Each molecule is provided in SMILES format:

- **CCCCc1noc([C@H]2C=CC(=N)S2)n1C**  
  (Added a methyl group to increase hydrophobicity.)

- **CCCCc1noc([C@H]2C=CC(=N)S2)n1CC**  
  (Added an ethyl group to further increase hydrophobicity.)

- **CCCCc1noc([C@H]2C=CC(=N)S2)n1c3ccccc3**  
  (Added a phenyl group to introduce aromatic hydrophobicity.)

- **CCCCc1noc([C@H]2C=CC(=N)S2)n1OC(C)=O**  
  (Added an ester group to reduce polarity while maintaining some bulk.)

- **CCCCc1noc([C@H]2C=CC(=N)S2)n1Cl**  
  (Added a chlorine atom to reduce solubility through halogenation.)

These modifications aim to reduce water solubility by increasing hydrophobicity or reducing polarity.

AI answer 0: To modify the molecule to lower permeability and increase tPSA (topological Polar Surface Area), we can introduce more polar groups or increase the size of existing polar functionalities. This typically involves adding or extending ether, amine, or hydroxyl groups which are known to increase polarity and thus tPSA, while also potentially reducing permeability due to increased hydrogen bonding and molecular size.

- **CC(C)n1nccc1NC(=O)N(C)C[C@H](O)CN1CCOC(O)C(O)CC1**: Added two hydroxyl groups to the ether chain to further increase polarity.
- **CC(C)n1nccc1NC(=O)N(C)C[C@H](O)CN1CCOC(N)CC1**: Replaced one oxygen in the ether chain with an amide group to enhance polarity and hydrogen bonding.
- **CC(C)n1nccc1NC(=O)N(C)C[C@H](O)CN1CCOCC(O)CC1**: Introduced a hydroxyl group on the terminal carbon of the ether chain to increase tPSA.

AI answer 0: To increase the topological polar surface area (tPSA) and lower the permeability of the molecule, we can introduce more polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups while maintaining structural similarity. Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format:

- **CCN(CC)C(=O)Cc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)CCOC#N)cc1**: Replaced a methyl group with a methoxy group on the side chain.

These modifications aim to introduce more polar interactions while keeping the overall structure similar to the original molecule.

AI answer 0: To increase the tPSA (topological polar surface area) and lower the permeability of the molecule, we can introduce more polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. This can be done by adding functional groups like amines, hydroxyls, or ethers which are known to increase tPSA and reduce permeability. Here are five modified molecules based on your starting structure:

- CCN(C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1)c1ccc(C#N)c(O)c1
- CCN(C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1)c1ccc(C#N)c(Cl)c1O

- CCN(C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1)c1ccc(C#N)c(Cl)c1NC(=O)O

Each modification aims to introduce or enhance polar functionalities, thereby increasing tPSA and potentially reducing permeability.

- **Molecule 3:** C[C@H]1C(=O)N2CCCc3cc(NC(=O)C(=O)NCC[C@@H](O)C(C)(C)C[NH2+][O-])cc1c32
  - Introduced an ammonium (-NH3+) and an oxygen anion (-O-) to increase polarity.

- **Molecule 4:** C[C@H]1C(=O)N2CCCc3cc(NC(=O)C(=O)NCC[C@@H](O)C(C)(C)CNC(=O)O)cc1c32
  - Added an amide group (-CONH-) linked to another carboxylic acid.

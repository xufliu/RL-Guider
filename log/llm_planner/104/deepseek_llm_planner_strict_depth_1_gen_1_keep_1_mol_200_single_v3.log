AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to consider modifications that disrupt drug-like properties. Here are some reasoning steps:

1. **Disrupting Drug-Like Features**: Drug-like molecules often have specific features such as hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, aromatic rings, and favorable logP values. Modifying these features can reduce the QED.

2. **Increasing Molecular Complexity or Weight**: Adding bulky groups or increasing molecular weight can decrease QED, as these changes often make the molecule less drug-like.

3. **Reducing Hydrogen Bonding Capacity**: Removing or replacing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED.

4. **Introducing Unfavorable Groups**: Adding groups that are not typically found in drugs (e.g., large alkyl chains, polar groups) can reduce QED.

5. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.

Given these considerations, here is the top suggestion:

---

**final_suggestion = ["Replace the primary amine group with a larger alkyl group such as a butyl group."]**

---

This modification is likely to decrease the QED by disrupting the hydrogen bonding capacity and increasing the molecular weight, while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the root molecule to decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule. This involves making the molecule less drug-like.

2. **Current QED:** The QED of the root molecule is 0.6120569607053138. We need to decrease it below 0.5120569607053138.

3. **Action Space:** Possible modifications include adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups.

4. **Similarity Consideration:** The modified molecules should retain a significant portion of the original structure to ensure similarity.

5. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we can introduce features that reduce drug-likeness, such as adding bulky groups, increasing hydrophobicity, or introducing less common functional groups.

6. **Potential Modifications:**
   - Add a bulky group (e.g., a phenyl ring) to increase steric hindrance.
   - Replace a polar group (e.g., amide) with a less polar or non-polar group.
   - Introduce a less common functional group (e.g., nitro group) that reduces drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)C(=O)) with a nitro group (NO2) to decrease polarity and drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Understand the goal**: We need to modify the molecule `CCC[NH2+]Cc1ncoc1-c1c(F)cccc1F` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should remain structurally similar to the original molecule.

2. **Analyze the molecule**: The molecule contains an amine group (`[NH2+]`), an aromatic ring with fluorine substitutions (`c1c(F)cccc1F`), and an ether linkage (`ncoc`). To decrease QED, we can make modifications that reduce drug-likeness, such as introducing bulky groups, adding polar groups, or disrupting aromaticity.

3. **Consider QED factors**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, polarity, solubility, and rigidity. To decrease QED, we can introduce groups that increase molecular complexity or reduce solubility.

4. **Maintain similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.

5. **Avoid previous suggestions**: Ensure that the modifications are novel and not repeat previous suggestions.

**Reasoning for the modification**:
- Replacing the amine group (`[NH2+]`) with a less polar group like a hydroxyl group could decrease QED by reducing polarity and making the molecule less drug-like. This change maintains structural similarity while achieving the desired QED reduction.

**Final suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amine group with a hydroxyl group"]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task step-by-step to ensure we achieve the goal effectively:

### **Reasoning Process**
1. **Goal**: Modify `root_molecule` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Constraints**:
     - The QED of `root_molecule` is 0.6009762687271423, so the new QED should be below 0.5009762687271423.
     - The new molecules should remain structurally similar to `root_molecule`.
     - Only SMILES strings should be provided as outputs.
     - Avoid repeating previous suggestions.
3. **Strategies to Decrease QED**:
     - Add or introduce functional groups that are less drug-like (e.g., bulky or polar groups).
     - Remove or replace functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness (e.g., amide, aromatic rings).
     - Introduce steric hindrance or less favorable physicochemical properties (e.g., larger groups, less hydrogen bonding potential).
4. **Similarity Consideration**: Focus on modifications that alter the molecule’s properties without drastically changing its core structure.

### **Top-1 Suggestion**
Based on the above reasoning, here is the most appropriate modification:

### **`final_suggestion`**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a bulky sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O))."]
```

This modification introduces a less drug-like and more polar functional group, which will likely decrease the QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The task is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1, while keeping the modified molecules structurally similar to the original.

2. **QED Reduction Strategy**: To reduce QED, we need to introduce changes that decrease drug-likeness. This can be achieved by:
   - Adding bulky or non-polar groups that reduce solubility.
   - Removing or replacing functional groups that are typically associated with drug-likeness (e.g., amides, sulfonamides, etc.).
   - Introducing steric hindrance or reducing hydrogen bonding potential.

3. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should be minor to ensure that the new molecules remain structurally similar to the root molecule.

4. **Action Space**: The suggested modifications will involve adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups in the molecule.

### Suggested Modification:
The amide group (`NC(=O)`) is a common functional group in drugs and contributes significantly to drug-likeness. Replacing this group with a bulkier, less polar group (e.g., an ester) can reduce QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with an ester group (COO) in the molecule."]
```

This modification is likely to decrease the QED by introducing a less polar functional group, which reduces drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule while keeping it similar in structure, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-like properties. The QED score is influenced by various molecular properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, and rotatable bonds. Here’s the reasoning process for achieving the goal:

1. **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding heavier atoms or functional groups can decrease QED. For example, adding a large aromatic ring or a long alkyl chain.
2. **Increase LogP**: Introducing hydrophobic groups like aromatic rings or alkyl chains can increase logP, which typically decreases QED.
3. **Reduce Hydrogen Bond Acceptors/Donors**: Removing or replacing polar groups like amines or carbonyls with non-polar groups can reduce QED.
4. **Increase Rotatable Bonds**: Adding flexible chains or groups can increase the number of rotatable bonds, which tends to decrease QED.
5. **Reduce Polar Surface Area**: Replacing polar groups with non-polar ones can decrease the polar surface area and thus reduce QED.

Given these considerations, one effective way is to **replace the carboxyl group with a more hydrophobic group** such as an alkyl chain. This modification increases logP and reduces the polar surface area, which should decrease the QED by more than 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carboxyl group (C(=O)O) with a methyl group (CH3) to increase hydrophobicity and reduce QED."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the `root_molecule` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
   
2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the `root_molecule` is 0.4045. We need to decrease it to below 0.3045. QED is influenced by properties like molecular weight, polarity, and presence of certain functional groups. To decrease QED, we can introduce less drug-like features, such as bulky or polar groups, or remove features that contribute to drug-likeness.

3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

4. **Action Space**: We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. Adding bulky or polar groups is a common strategy to decrease QED.

5. **Previous Experience**: From previous experience, adding large or charged groups tends to decrease QED significantly.

6. **Suggestion**: Replace the nitro group (`[N+](=O)[O-]`) with a bulkier and less drug-like group, such as a sulfonic acid group (`S(=O)(=O)OH`). This modification increases polarity and bulkiness, which decreases QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a sulfonic acid group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the given molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining its structural similarity, we need to introduce changes that reduce its drug-like properties. This can be achieved by modifying functional groups or atoms that are known to contribute to drug-likeness, such as adding bulkier groups, introducing less polar or less soluble moieties, or disrupting key pharmacophoric features.

Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Target Functional Groups**: The molecule contains an amine group, a quaternary ammonium group, and a chloro-substituted thiophene ring. These are key features contributing to its drug-likeness. Modifying these groups can reduce QED.
2. **Introduce Bulky or Polar Groups**: Adding bulkier, less polar groups can reduce solubility and disrupt molecular interactions, thereby decreasing QED.
3. **Disrupt Pharmacophoric Features**: Altering the amine or quaternary ammonium groups can reduce the molecule’s potential to interact with biological targets.
4. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically change the core structure to ensure the new molecule remains similar to the original.
5. **Previous Experience**: Based on past modifications, replacing polar groups with bulkier or less polar groups has been effective in reducing QED.

### Suggested Modification:
Replace the amine group (`NCC(C)(C)[NH+]1CCN(C)CC1`) with a less polar and more sterically hindered group, such as a tert-butyl group. This modification will reduce the molecule’s drug-likeness by decreasing its polarity and increasing steric hindrance.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amine group (NCC(C)(C)[NH+]1CCN(C)CC1) with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective**: Decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The current QED is 0.844823447979166.

2. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness. This can be achieved by introducing less favorable functional groups or altering the structure to make it less compliant with drug-like properties.

3. **Possible Modifications**:
   - **Replace the amide group** with a less favorable functional group.
   - **Introduce a bulky group** that disrupts the molecule's compactness.
   - **Add a polar group** that reduces the overall lipophilicity.

4. **Considerations**:
   - The modification should not drastically change the overall structure to maintain similarity.
   - The change should lead to a significant decrease in QED (more than 0.1).

5. **Selection**: Replace the amide group with a less favorable functional group, such as an ester. This modification is likely to decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Here’s the reasoning process for modifying the root molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity:

1. **Understand the QED components**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. Reducing drug-likeness typically involves introducing less favorable features, such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding bulky groups, or reducing hydrogen bonding potential.

2. **Maintain similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule while introducing changes that decrease QED.

3. **Targeted modifications**:
   - Introduce a hydrophobic group (e.g., an alkyl chain) to increase logP.
   - Add a bulky group to increase molecular weight and decrease drug-likeness.
   - Replace a polar group (e.g., amino group) with a less polar one.

4. **Avoid repeating previous suggestions**: Ensure the suggested modifications are unique and have not been proposed before.

Here’s the top-1 suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amino group attached to the pyrimidine ring with a methyl group to reduce polarity and hydrogen bonding potential."]

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the problem step-by-step to achieve the goal:

### Goal:
- Modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.

### Analysis:
1. **QED Reduction**: To decrease QED by more than 0.1, we need to introduce changes that reduce drug-likeness. This can be achieved by:
   - Adding bulky or polar groups.
   - Introducing less favorable functional groups in drug-like contexts (e.g., nitro groups, sulfonates).
   - Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.
   - Increasing molecular weight or hydrophobicity.

2. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should be subtle to keep the molecule similar to the root molecule. Changes to peripheral groups or small functional groups are preferred over altering the core structure.

3. **Previous Experience**: Based on drug design knowledge, modifying the amide group, introducing steric hindrance, or adding polar groups can significantly reduce QED without drastically changing the structure.

### Suggested Modification:
Replace the amide group (CONH) with a less drug-like functional group, such as a sulfonamide group (SO2NH2), which is bulkier and more polar. This modification is known to reduce QED while maintaining similarity to the original structure.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (CONH) with a sulfonamide group (SO2NH2) to decrease drug-likeness and reduce QED."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties of the molecule. The Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and aromaticity. By introducing changes that negatively impact these factors, we can lower the QED.

Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Hydrophobicity and Aromaticity**: Introducing more hydrophobic groups or disrupting aromatic systems can decrease QED. For example, adding bulky hydrophobic groups or replacing aromatic rings with aliphatic chains.

2. **Hydrogen Bonding**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED. This can be achieved by replacing polar groups with non-polar ones.

3. **Molecular Weight**: Increasing the molecular weight beyond the optimal range for drug-like molecules can decrease QED. This can be done by adding large substituents.

4. **Structural Similarity**: To maintain similarity, the modifications should be minor, such as replacing a single functional group or adding a small substituent without drastically altering the core structure.

5. **Avoid Repeating Previous Suggestions**: Ensure that the suggested modifications are novel and not repeated from previous suggestions.

Based on these considerations, I suggest the following modification:

**Replace the amide group (NC=O) with a methyl group**

This change will reduce the number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors and introduce a hydrophobic group, which should lower the QED. This modification is minor and maintains the structural similarity to the original molecule.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC=O) with a methyl group"]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness while maintaining some structural similarity. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Reduce Drug-Likeness**: Drug-likeness is often associated with properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To decrease QED, we should introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as adding bulky hydrophobic groups or removing polar functional groups.

2. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. This means we should focus on modifying substituents or adding/removing functional groups in a way that doesn’t change the overall scaffold significantly.

3. **Strategy**:
   - **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Adding large hydrophobic groups can decrease QED by increasing molecular weight and hydrophobicity.
   - **Remove Polar Groups**: Removing polar groups like hydroxyl or amide groups can reduce drug-likeness.
   - **Introduce Steric Hindrance**: Adding groups that introduce steric hindrance can make the molecule less drug-like.

Based on these considerations, the best suggestion is to **replace the hydroxyl group with a bulky hydrophobic group**. This modification will increase hydrophobicity and molecular weight, thereby reducing QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-like properties while maintaining structural similarity. QED is influenced by various factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To achieve this, we can introduce less drug-like features, such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding bulky groups, or reducing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors/donors.

Given the structure of the root molecule, we can target the nitro group (`O=[N+]([O-])`), the oxadiazole ring (`C2=NOc3cc(Cl)ccc3N2`), or the aromatic ring system for modifications. To decrease QED, we could replace the nitro group with a less polar group, introduce bulkier substituents, or reduce the number of hydrogen bond acceptors.

After considering the guidelines, the most effective modification would be to **replace the nitro group with a trifluoromethyl group**. This change increases hydrophobicity and reduces hydrogen bond acceptor capacity, thereby decreasing QED. Additionally, this modification maintains structural similarity to the original molecule.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a trifluoromethyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the root molecule, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. This can be achieved by introducing or modifying functional groups in a way that disrupts key drug-like properties, such as solubility, polarity, or molecular weight.

1. **Reasoning Process**:
   - The molecule contains several aromatic rings, an amide group, and a fluorine atom. These are typical features in drug-like molecules.
   - To reduce QED, we can introduce bulkier or less polar groups, or replace polar groups with non-polar ones.
   - The molecule has an amide group (`NC(=O)`), which is a key functional group in many drugs. Modifying this group could significantly impact QED.
   - The fluorine atom is a common substituent in drugs. Replacing it with a less polar or bulkier group could reduce QED.
   - Alternatively, introducing a bulky, non-polar group like a tert-butyl group could decrease QED.

2. **Suggestions**:
   - Replace the amide group with a less polar functional group, such as an ester or ether.
   - Replace the fluorine atom with a more bulky, non-polar group like a tert-butyl group.
   - Add a bulky, non-polar group to one of the aromatic rings.
   - Introduce a long aliphatic chain to decrease polarity.
   - Replace the methoxy group (`COc`) with a less polar group like a methyl group.

3. **Final Suggestion**:
   - The most effective single modification would be to replace the amide group with a less polar functional group, such as an ester, which would decrease polarity and disrupt a key feature of drug-likeness.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group to decrease polarity and reduce QED."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the given molecule by at least 0.1 while keeping the molecule similar to the original, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-like properties. This can be achieved by:

1. **Adding or increasing the size of non-drug-like functional groups**: Introducing bulky or non-polar groups can reduce QED.
2. **Replacing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups with non-polar groups**: This reduces solubility and drug-likeness.
3. **Introducing steric hindrance**: Adding bulky groups or rings can decrease QED.
4. **Removing or replacing aromatic rings**: Aromatic rings are often associated with drug-like properties.

Considering the structure of the molecule, one effective way to reduce QED is to **replace the aromatic thiophene ring (c1cccs1) with a larger, non-aromatic, and less polar group**. This modification will maintain some structural similarity while significantly decreasing QED.

### Reasoning:
- The thiophene ring is a common feature in drug-like molecules, contributing to aromaticity and planarity, which are favorable in drug design.
- Replacing it with a non-aromatic, bulky group (e.g., a cyclohexane ring) will reduce drug-likeness and decrease QED by more than 0.1.
- This change maintains the core structure of the molecule while altering a key feature responsible for its drug-like properties.

final_suggestion = ["Replace the aromatic thiophene ring (c1cccs1) with a non-aromatic cyclohexane ring."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the root molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that reduce drug-likeness. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Drug-likeness and QED**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by various molecular properties such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups. To decrease QED, we need to introduce changes that make the molecule less favorable in terms of these properties.

2. **Similarity**: The modified molecules should retain the core structure of the root molecule to ensure similarity. This means the modifications should be localized and not drastically alter the overall scaffold.

3. **Modification strategy**: Introducing bulky or polar substituents, or replacing certain functional groups with less drug-like ones, can effectively reduce the QED. For example, adding a hydroxyl group or replacing an amine with a less favorable group could achieve this.

4. **Avoiding repetition**: The modification should not repeat any previous suggestions and should be unique in its approach.

Based on this reasoning, the top suggestion for the modification is:

**Final suggestion**: Replace the positively charged amino group with a carboxyl group to increase polarity and reduce drug-likeness.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the positively charged amino group with a carboxyl group to increase polarity and reduce drug-likeness."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule (CC[C@H](NC(=O)NCc1ccnc(OC)c1)c1cccc(Cl)c1) to make it less drug-like and decrease the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule.

2. **QED Reduction Strategy**: To reduce the QED, we can introduce modifications that decrease the drug-likeness, such as:
   - Adding bulky or polar groups.
   - Introducing less common functional groups.
   - Removing or replacing key functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness.

3. **Similarity Consideration**: The modified molecule should still resemble the original structure, so changes should be subtle and localized.

4. **Action Space**: Based on the given action space, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups.

5. **Previous Experience**: Learning from previous substructure changes, replacing the amide group (NC(=O)) with a less drug-like functional group or introducing a polar group like a sulfonamide could effectively reduce the QED.

6. **Specific Suggestion**: Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)) to decrease drug-likeness and reduce the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)) in the molecule."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: Modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug, decrease its QED by at least 0.1, and ensure the output molecules are similar to the input molecule.

2. **QED Considerations**: The current QED of the root molecule is 0.623. To decrease it by at least 0.1, the new QED should be ≤ 0.523.

3. **Similarity Considerations**: The modified molecule should retain structural similarity to the root molecule. Key structural features include the central thioether bond, the aromatic rings, and the carbonyl groups.

4. **Strategies to Decrease QED**:
   - **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding bulky groups or increasing the size of existing groups can decrease QED.
   - **Introduce Hydrophobic Groups**: Hydrophobic groups can reduce QED by making the molecule less drug-like.
   - **Increase Complexity**: Adding additional ring systems or branching can decrease QED.

5. **Potential Modifications**:
   - **Add a Bulky Group**: Adding a large hydrophobic group (e.g., a phenyl ring) can decrease QED.
   - **Replace an Atom with a Larger Group**: Replacing a hydrogen atom with a larger group can increase molecular weight and complexity.
   - **Introduce a Hydrophobic Substituent**: Adding a hydrophobic group (e.g., a long alkyl chain) can decrease QED.

6. **Final Decision**: Based on the goal of decreasing QED while maintaining similarity, the best action is to **add a bulky hydrophobic group** to the molecule. This modification will increase the molecular weight and decrease the QED, while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the root molecule.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a phenyl group to the methylene carbon in the aromatic ring."]
```

This modification will introduce a bulky hydrophobic group that is likely to decrease the QED by the required amount while maintaining the structural similarity to the root molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. This can be achieved by introducing less favorable functional groups or altering the molecular structure in a way that decreases its overall desirability as a drug candidate. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify Key Functional Groups**: The root molecule contains an amine group, a carboxylate group, and a chlorinated aromatic ring. These are common in drugs, so modifying them can reduce QED.
  
2. **Reduce Drug-Likeness**: To decrease QED, we can introduce less favorable functional groups such as bulky substituents, less polar groups, or groups that increase molecular weight significantly.

3. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

Based on this, the top-1 suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carboxylate group with a nitro group"]
```

This modification introduces a less favorable functional group (nitro group) in place of the carboxylate group, which is likely to decrease the QED significantly while maintaining the overall structure of the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the root molecule, we need to carefully modify the molecule in a way that reduces its "drug-likeness." The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To reduce QED, we can consider the following strategies:

1. **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding heavier atoms or larger functional groups can decrease QED.
2. **Increase Hydrophobicity**: Adding non-polar groups or removing polar groups can reduce QED.
3. **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Adding bulky groups that disrupt the molecular shape can decrease QED.
4. **Reduce Aromaticity**: Reducing the number of aromatic rings or introducing aliphatic chains can decrease QED.
5. **Remove Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Removing functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds can reduce QED.

Given these strategies, we can focus on modifying specific parts of the molecule while maintaining its overall structure. The substituent `-c2nnco2` (a heterocyclic group) and the `[C@@H]` chiral center are key areas for modification. We can suggest replacing or modifying these groups to reduce QED.

### Reasoning Process:
- **Modification of the Heterocyclic Group**: The `-c2nnco2` group is a five-membered heterocycle that likely contributes to the drug-likeness of the molecule. Replacing this group with a simpler or bulkier group could decrease QED.
- **Modification of the Chiral Center**: The `[C@@H]` chiral center could be modified to introduce a bulkier or less polar group, which would reduce QED.
- **Adding Bulky Groups**: Introducing a bulky group, such as a tert-butyl group, could disrupt the molecular shape and reduce QED.

Based on this reasoning, the top suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the heterocyclic group (-c2nnco2) with a bulkier tert-butyl group."]
```

This modification is expected to decrease QED by increasing hydrophobicity and molecular weight while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To address the task, we need to modify the molecule **COc1cc(Br)c(S(N)(=O)=O)cc1C(=O)N[C@@H](C)Cc1cccs1** to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least **0.1**. The modifications should maintain structural similarity to the original molecule while achieving the desired change in QED.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: Decrease QED by at least **0.1**, making the molecule less drug-like.
2. **Strategy**: Introduce functional groups or modifications that negatively impact drug-likeness. For example:
   - Adding polar or bulky groups that hinder permeability.
   - Increasing molecular weight or logP beyond typical drug-like ranges.
   - Disrupting key features like hydrogen bond donors/acceptors or aromaticity.
3. **Considerations**:
   - Maintain structural similarity by targeting peripheral or non-core parts of the molecule.
   - Avoid drastic changes that could alter the molecule's scaffold or key pharmacophores.
4. **Actions**:
   - Replace the **methyl group** attached to the oxygen (in the methoxy group) with a **bulky tert-butyl group** to increase steric hindrance and decrease drug-likeness.
   - Add a **sulfonate group** to the phenyl ring to increase polarity and reduce permeability.
   - Replace the **carbonyl group (C=O)** with a **carboxylic acid group** to increase hydrophilicity and introduce a charged species at physiological pH.
   - Add a **nitro group** to the phenyl ring to increase polarity and disrupt aromaticity.
   - Replace the **bromine atom** with a **polar hydroxyl group**.

### Top Suggestion:
Based on the reasoning, the most effective and structurally similar modification is to **replace the methyl group attached to the oxygen (in the methoxy group) with a tert-butyl group**. This increases steric hindrance and molecular weight, reducing drug-likeness without significantly altering the core structure.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methyl group attached to the oxygen (in the methoxy group) with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we can consider the following reasoning:

1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, altering hydrophobicity, or reducing hydrogen bonding potential.

2. **Similarity Constraint**: The modified molecules should retain the core structure of the original molecule to ensure similarity. This means we should avoid drastic changes to the main scaffold.

3. **Functional Group Modifications**: Adding bulky or non-polar groups, replacing polar groups with non-polar ones, or introducing groups that disrupt hydrogen bonding can help reduce QED.

4. **Experience from Previous Changes**: We can learn from common modifications that decrease QED, such as adding large hydrophobic groups or removing polar functional groups.

Based on this reasoning, the most effective modification would be to add a bulky, non-polar group to the molecule, which would increase molecular weight and hydrophobicity, thereby decreasing QED.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: Modify the root molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule. The QED of the root molecule is 0.7738014655155391, so the target QED should be below 0.6738014655155391.

2. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less drug-like, such as adding bulky groups, increasing hydrophobicity, or adding polar groups in a way that disrupts the balance of drug-like properties. However, we need to ensure the molecule remains structurally similar to the original.

3. **Focus**: The root molecule has a benzene ring with a chlorine atom, an ammonium group, and an isobutyl chain. Modifying these regions while keeping the core structure intact can help achieve the goal.

4. **Possible Actions**:
   - Replace the ammonium group with a less polar or bulkier group.
   - Add a large hydrophobic group to the benzene ring.
   - Replace the chlorine atom with a less drug-like substituent.
   - Add a polar group in a way that disrupts the drug-like balance.

5. **Constraint**: The modification should not repeat previous suggestions and should maintain structural similarity.

6. **Final Decision**: Add a large hydrophobic group to the benzene ring, as this will increase hydrophobicity and disrupt the drug-like properties, reducing the QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a tert-butyl group to the benzene ring at the meta position relative to the chlorine atom."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **QED Reduction Strategy:** To reduce QED, we should introduce features that are less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as:
   - Increasing molecular weight.
   - Introducing bulky or polar groups.
   - Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.
   - Introducing groups that decrease solubility or increase lipophilicity.
3. **Structural Similarity:** The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. Instead, focus on adding or replacing functional groups or atoms while preserving the overall scaffold.
4. **Action Space:** Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.

**Final Suggestion:**

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **QED Analysis:** The current QED of the root molecule is 0.8520522380780098. To decrease QED by at least 0.1, the modified molecule should have a QED of 0.7520522380780098 or lower.

3. **Modification Strategy:** To decrease QED, we can introduce less drug-like features such as:
   - Increasing molecular weight or complexity.
   - Introducing less polar or more hydrophobic groups.
   - Adding bulky or non-traditional functional groups.
   - Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.

4. **Structural Similarity:** The modified molecule should remain similar to the root molecule, so changes should be localized and not drastically alter the core structure.

5. **Action Space:** Based on the action space (add, delete, replace), we can consider replacing or adding functional groups that reduce drug-likeness.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The primary goal is to modify the root molecule (`CCc1ccc(CNC(=O)C(=O)Nc2ccc(C(=O)OC)cc2)s1`) to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1. The QED of the root molecule is 0.6428464712697184, so the target QED should be less than 0.5428464712697184.

2. **Chemical Features Affecting QED:** QED is influenced by several molecular properties, including molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, polar surface area, and the number of rotatable bonds. To decrease QED, we need to make modifications that push these properties further away from drug-like values. For example:
   - Increasing molecular weight or logP.
   - Decreasing the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.
   - Introducing bulky or non-polar groups.

3. **Modification Strategy:** 
   - The root molecule contains a thiophene ring (`s1`), an amide group (`C(=O)N`), and an ester group (`C(=O)OC`). These functional groups contribute to the drug-like nature of the molecule.
   - To decrease QED, we can modify or replace these functional groups with less drug-like groups, such as converting the ester group (`C(=O)OC`) to a less polar or bulkier group.

4. **Suggestion:** Replace the ester group (`C(=O)OC`) with a non-polar, bulky group like a tert-butyl group. This change will increase the logP and molecular weight while reducing the polarity, thus decreasing the QED.

5. **Similarity Consideration:** The modification should preserve the overall structure of the molecule to maintain similarity to the root molecule.

**Final Suggestion:**
Replace the ester group with a tert-butyl group.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ester group with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule `CCC[C@H]1CN(C(=O)[C@@H]2COc3ccc(Br)cc32)CCO1` to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The current QED is 0.837, so the new QED should be ≤ 0.737.

2. **QED Considerations**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by molecular properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To reduce QED, we need to make the molecule less drug-like by altering these properties.

3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should retain the core structure of the molecule (e.g., the bicyclic system, stereochemistry, and key functional groups like the amide and ether) to ensure similarity.

4. **Suggested Modifications**:
   - **Add a Bulky Group**: Introducing a bulky group (e.g., a phenyl ring) can increase molecular weight and logP, decreasing QED.
   - **Replace Bromine with a Larger Halogen**: Replacing bromine with iodine increases molecular weight and logP.
   - **Introduce a Polar Group**: Adding a polar group (e.g., a hydroxyl group) can increase polar surface area and decrease QED.
   - **Remove a Functional Group**: Deleting a small functional group (e.g., the methylene group in the CCO1 ring) can disrupt the molecule’s drug-like properties.
   - **Alter the Amide Group**: Converting the amide to a less drug-like functional group (e.g., an ester) can decrease QED.

5. **Top Suggestion**: The most effective modification to achieve the target QED reduction while maintaining similarity is to **introduce a bulky phenyl group**.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule \( \text{CCN(CC)C(=O)Cc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)CCC#N)cc1} \) to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The output molecules should remain structurally similar to the input molecule.

2. **QED Considerations**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.839. To decrease it by at least 0.1, the modified molecule should have a QED below 0.739.

3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should retain the core structure of the molecule while introducing changes that reduce drug-likeness.

4. **Action Space**: The modifications can involve adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups. The changes should be meaningful enough to impact QED but not so drastic that the molecule becomes unrecognizable.

5. **Strategies to Decrease QED**:
   - **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding larger groups or atoms can decrease QED.
   - **Increase Hydrophobicity**: Introducing hydrophobic groups can reduce QED.
   - **Increase Flexibility**: Adding flexible chains or rings can decrease QED.
   - **Introduce Unfavorable Functional Groups**: Adding groups like nitro, sulfone, or large alkyl chains can reduce QED.

6. **Proposed Modification**: Replace the nitrile group (−C#N) with a more complex and less drug-like functional group, such as a sulfone group (−SO2−). This change increases molecular weight and introduces a less favorable functional group, which should decrease QED by more than 0.1.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify Functional Groups**: The molecule contains an ether group (C-O-C), an alcohol group (O-), a secondary amine (NH+), an amide (C(=O)N), and a nitrile (C#N). These groups contribute to the drug-likeness of the molecule.

2. **Target Groups for Modification**: To decrease QED, we should modify or replace functional groups that are typically associated with drug-likeness. For example, the amide group or the nitrile group could be replaced with less drug-like groups.

3. **Consider Similarity**: The modifications should maintain the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity. For instance, replacing the nitrile group with a less polar or less drug-like group (e.g., a hydrocarbon chain) would decrease QED while keeping the molecule similar.

4. **Action Suggestion**: Replace the nitrile group with a methyl group. This modification reduces the polarity and drug-likeness of the molecule, thereby decreasing the QED.

final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitrile group with a methyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0:     Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Understand the goal**: We need to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should still be structurally similar to the root molecule.

2. **Analyze the root molecule**: The root molecule (CC[C@H](C)C(=O)[C@@H](C)c1ccncc1) contains a ketone group, an aliphatic chain, and a pyridine ring. To decrease QED, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-likeness, such as introducing less favorable functional groups or reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

3. **Previous experience**: From previous examples, we know that adding bulky or less drug-like groups (e.g., nitro groups, halogens) or removing favorable groups (e.g., carbonyls) can decrease QED.

4. **Generate suggestions**:
   - **Replace the ketone group with a less favorable group**: Ketones are drug-like, so replacing the carbonyl with a less favorable group like an ester or aldehyde could reduce QED.
   - **Introduce a nitro group on the pyridine ring**: Nitro groups are less drug-like and can significantly decrease QED.
   - **Add a halogen to the aliphatic chain**: Halogens can reduce drug-likeness.
   - **Replace the pyridine ring with a less drug-like aromatic ring**: For example, a benzene ring with no heteroatoms.
   - **Introduce a bulky alkyl group**: Adding a large alkyl group can reduce drug-likeness.

5. **Select the top suggestion**: Based on the above reasoning, replacing the ketone group with a less favorable group like an ester or aldehyde is a straightforward and effective way to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

6. **Final suggestion**:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ketone group with an ester group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we can consider making modifications that reduce the drug-likeness. The QED score is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To achieve the goal, we can:

1. **Introduce bulky or non-polar groups**: Adding non-polar or bulky groups can decrease the QED score by increasing the molecular weight and logP, making the molecule less drug-like.
2. **Remove or replace polar functional groups**: Removing or replacing polar groups like amides or ethers with non-polar groups can reduce the hydrogen bond donor/acceptor count and polar surface area.
3. **Add steric hindrance**: Introducing sterically bulky groups can make the molecule less drug-like and lower the QED score.
4. **Alter aromatic systems**: Modifying aromatic rings by adding substituents or replacing them with less polar systems can decrease the QED score.

Considering the similarity to the root molecule, the best action is to **add a bulky non-polar group** to one of the aromatic rings, as this will significantly impact the QED score while maintaining structural similarity.

final_suggestion = ["Add a tert-butyl group to one of the benzene rings in the molecule."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of **root_molecule** by more than 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness. Here’s the reasoning process:

### Reasoning Process:
1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) can be decreased by introducing features that are less drug-like, such as adding polar groups, increasing molecular weight, or disrupting aromaticity.
2. **Similarity Consideration**: To maintain similarity, changes should be made to less critical parts of the molecule, such as the side chain or peripheral groups.
3. **Functional Group Modification**: Adding or replacing functional groups that are less common in drug-like molecules (e.g., nitro groups, sulfonic acids) can significantly reduce QED.
4. **Avoiding Repetition**: Ensure the suggested modifications are distinct from previous suggestions.

### Final Suggestion:
Replace the methyl group attached to the nitrogen atom in the pyrazole ring with a nitro group.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methyl group attached to the nitrogen atom in the pyrazole ring with a nitro group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the goal and guidelines systematically:

1. **Goal**: Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Current QED**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.8637, so the target QED after modification should be ≤ 0.7637.
3. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.
4. **Similarity**: The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the input molecule.

### Reasoning Process:
To decrease QED and make the molecule less drug-like, we can focus on:
- Introducing bulky or non-drug-like groups that disrupt the molecule's physicochemical properties.
- Replacing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups with non-polar or sterically hindered groups.
- Adding groups that increase molecular weight or hydrophobicity, as these tend to lower QED.

### Suggestion:
A straightforward change would be to replace the **carbonyl group (C=O)** in the **amide functional group** with a **bulky alkyl group**, as this would disrupt hydrogen bonding and introduce steric hindrance, both of which decrease QED. The amide group is a key contributor to drug-likeness, and modifying it is likely to significantly reduce QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide functional group with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The objective is to modify the molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule.
2. **QED Analysis:** The current QED of the root molecule is 0.846. To decrease it by at least 0.1, the new QED should be ≤ 0.746.
3. **Structural Similarity:** The modifications should be minimal to ensure the new molecules remain similar to the root molecule.
4. **Action Space:** The allowed actions are adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups.
5. **Strategy:** To reduce QED, we can introduce features that are less drug-like (e.g., adding bulky groups, reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or introducing unfavorable properties like increased hydrophobicity or molecular weight).

**Suggested Modification:**
- Replace the amide group (`NC(=O)`) with a less polar and less drug-like functional group, such as an ether group (`O`).

This modification will reduce the polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing the QED.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ether group in the molecule."]

1. **Goal**: We need to modify `root_molecule` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of `root_molecule` is 0.326. To decrease it by at least 0.1, the new QED should be ≤ 0.226.

3. **Molecular Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

4. **Modification Strategy**:
   - **Decrease Drug-Likeness**: This can be achieved by adding bulky groups, introducing less polar functional groups, or disrupting aromaticity.
   - **Decrease QED**: Adding large hydrophobic groups, removing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or increasing molecular weight can reduce QED.

5. **Action Space**: Based on the structure of `root_molecule`, one effective way to decrease QED is to replace a polar or aromatic group with a bulky, non-polar group.

6. **Implementing the Strategy**: Replace the oxazole ring (`noc`) with a more bulky and less polar group, such as a cyclohexane ring.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the `root_molecule` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.622. To decrease it by at least 0.1, the target QED should be ≤ 0.522. QED is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can make the molecule more complex, increase logP, or introduce less favorable functional groups.

3. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule has a fused bicyclic structure with a phenyl ring, a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, and an amidine group. To maintain similarity, modifications should focus on adding or replacing functional groups without altering the core structure significantly.

4. **Suggested Modifications**:
   - **Add a bulky hydrophobic group**: Increasing hydrophobicity can reduce QED. Adding a tert-butyl group to the phenyl ring would increase logP and molecular weight.
   - **Replace the amidine group with a less polar group**: The amidine group is polar and contributes positively to QED. Replacing it with a less polar group, such as a methyl group, would decrease QED.
   - **Introduce a halogen atom**: Adding a chlorine or bromine atom to the phenyl ring would increase molecular weight and logP.
   - **Add a nitro group**: Nitro groups are less favorable in drug design and would decrease QED.
   - **Introduce a carboxylic acid group**: While polar, carboxylic acids can sometimes decrease QED due to their high molecular weight and impact on logP.

5. **Top Suggestion**: Adding a bulky hydrophobic group (tert-butyl) to the phenyl ring is likely to decrease QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a tert-butyl group to the phenyl ring of the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we must consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties of the molecule. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To lower the QED, we can introduce changes that make the molecule less compliant with drug-like criteria, such as increasing its hydrophobicity or molecular weight unnecessarily, or by adding groups that are atypical in drugs.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Increase Hydrophobicity**: Adding non-polar groups like alkyl chains can increase logP, which might lower QED.
2. **Disrupt Hydrogen Bonding**: Removing or replacing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors can reduce drug-likeness.
3. **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Adding large, sterically hindering groups can negatively impact drug-likeness.
4. **Add Atypical Functional Groups**: Incorporating groups that are uncommon in drugs (e.g., nitro groups) can reduce QED.
5. **Modify Stereochemistry**: Altering stereochemistry can sometimes reduce drug-likeness.

Based on these considerations, the most effective strategy would be to introduce a bulky, non-polar group that disrupts the molecule's drug-like properties while maintaining some structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group with a tert-butyl group to increase hydrophobicity and steric hindrance."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to consider modifications that disrupt favorable drug-like properties. Here's the reasoning and final suggestion:

1. **Reasoning Process**:
   - **QED Reduction**: To decrease QED, we should introduce features that are less desirable in drug-like molecules, such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding bulky groups, or introducing less common functional groups.
   - **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. Instead, we should make small, targeted changes.
   - **Previous Experience**: From past modifications, we know that replacing polar groups with non-polar groups or adding sterically hindering groups effectively reduces QED without significantly changing the overall structure.

2. **Suggested Action**:
   - **Replace the Amide Group with a Less Polar Group**: The amide group (`C(=O)N`) in the molecule contributes to its drug-like properties. Replacing it with a less polar functional group, such as an ester or ether, can decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

3. **Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (C(=O)N) with an ester group (C(=O)O) in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The goal is to modify the root molecule (`COc1cc(C[NH+]2CCC(OC[C@H]3CCCO3)CC2)ccc1SC`) to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **QED Analysis:** The QED of the root molecule is 0.762. To decrease it by more than 0.1, the modified molecule should have a QED below 0.662.

3. **Action Strategy:** To reduce QED, we can:
   - Increase molecular weight or complexity.
   - Introduce less drug-like features (e.g., larger or more hydrophobic groups).
   - Remove or replace functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness.

4. **Structural Similarity:** To maintain similarity, modifications should focus on peripheral functional groups or slight alterations in the core structure.

5. **Previous Experience:** Learn from previous modifications (if any) to avoid repeating ineffective changes.

6. **Final Suggestion:** Based on the above reasoning, the top suggestion is to **replace the methoxy group with a larger, less polar group** to decrease QED while maintaining similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to consider modifications that reduce drug-likeness. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To reduce QED, we can introduce larger or more hydrophobic groups, remove polar groups, or add sterically bulky groups.

The root molecule contains a thiazole ring (with a sulfur atom) and an imidazole ring. Introducing bulkier hydrophobic groups or reducing polarity in these regions could effectively decrease QED.

**Reasoning Process:**
1. The thiazole ring contains a sulfur atom, which is polar. Replacing the sulfur atom with a bulkier, non-polar group (e.g., a carbon atom) would reduce polarity and decrease QED.
2. Adding a large hydrophobic group (e.g., a phenyl ring) to the imidazole nitrogen would increase hydrophobicity and steric bulk, reducing QED.
3. Replacing the pyridine nitrogen in the imidazole ring with a carbon atom would reduce polarity and decrease QED.

Based on these considerations, the top suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfur atom in the thiazole ring with a carbon atom to reduce polarity and decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **QED Reduction Goal:** The goal is to decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, polarity, solubility, and the presence of certain functional groups that are commonly found in drugs. To reduce QED, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or introducing less common functional groups.

2. **Modification Strategy:** To ensure that the modified molecule remains similar to the root molecule, we should focus on making small modifications rather than large structural changes. Specifically, we can add or replace functional groups that are less common in drugs or increase the polarity of the molecule.

3. **Functional Group Considerations:** Adding polar groups like hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, or nitro groups can decrease QED by increasing hydrophilicity. However, we need to ensure that these changes do not drastically alter the overall structure of the molecule.

4. **Previous Experience:** Based on previous knowledge, adding a hydroxyl group to an aromatic ring or replacing a fluorine atom with a more polar group (like a nitro group) can effectively decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

5. **Final Decision:** The best action to take is to **replace the fluorine atom on the aromatic ring with a nitro group**. This modification increases the polarity and introduces a less common drug-like functional group, thus likely reducing the QED by more than 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluorine atom on the aromatic ring with a nitro group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The task is to modify the given molecule to make it "less like a drug" and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The QED of the root molecule is 0.926, so the target QED should be less than or equal to 0.826.

2. **Analyzing the Molecule**: The root molecule contains a chiral carbon, an amide group, a phenyl ring, and a tetrahydrofuran ring. To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-likeness, such as adding bulky groups, increasing hydrophobicity, or introducing less common functional groups.

3. **Possible Modifications**:
   - **Replace the amide group**: Amides are common in drugs, so replacing the amide with a less common functional group like an ester or sulfonamide could decrease QED.
   - **Introduce a bulky group**: Adding a bulky substituent like a tert-butyl group can decrease drug-likeness.
   - **Modify the phenyl ring**: Adding electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or cyano groups to the phenyl ring can reduce QED.
   - **Change the tetrahydrofuran ring**: Replacing the tetrahydrofuran ring with a larger or less common ring system like a cyclohexane or piperidine.

4. **Ensuring Similarity**: To maintain some similarity to the root molecule, the modifications should not drastically alter the overall structure. For example, replacing a single functional group or adding a small substituent would be preferable.

5. **Final Decision**: Based on the analysis, replacing the amide group with a sulfonamide group is a targeted modification that can decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)) in the molecule."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original structure. The QED of the root molecule is currently 0.8256, so the target QED should be less than 0.7256.

2. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are generally less desirable in drug-like molecules, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or introducing steric hindrance. However, we must ensure that the modifications do not drastically alter the overall structure to maintain similarity.

3. **Action Space**: Based on the molecule's structure, we can consider the following modifications:
   - **Adding polar groups**: This can increase hydrophilicity and decrease QED.
   - **Introducing steric hindrance**: Adding bulky groups can decrease QED.
   - **Replacing hydrogen atoms with larger substituents**: This can increase molecular weight and complexity.

4. **Specific Suggestions**:
   - **Add a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring (c1cnn(C)c1)**: This will increase polarity and slightly alter the molecule's hydrophobicity.
   - **Replace the methyl group (C) attached to the nitrogen in the imidazole ring with an ethyl group**: This will introduce steric hindrance and slightly increase molecular weight.
   - **Add a carboxyl group to the aliphatic chain (CC)**: This will significantly increase polarity and hydrophilicity.
   - **Replace the hydrogen atom on the nitrogen in the pyrrolidine ring with a methyl group**: This will introduce steric hindrance.
   - **Add a chlorine atom to the aromatic ring (c1cnn(C)c1)**: Halogens can increase molecular weight and sometimes decrease QED.

5. **Final Selection**: Among these, the most effective way to decrease QED while maintaining similarity is likely to **add a carboxyl group to the aliphatic chain (CC)**, as this introduces a highly polar group without drastically altering the core structure.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carboxyl group to the aliphatic chain (CC)."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule. The original QED is 0.535977402396774, so the target QED should be ≤ 0.435977402396774 after modification.
2. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce less drug-like features. This can be achieved by:
   - Removing or replacing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness (e.g., amide, ether, or positively charged groups).
   - Adding bulky or less polar groups that reduce drug-likeness.
3. **Focus**: The molecule has an ether group (C-O-C), a cyclic structure with a positive charge ([NH+]), and an amide group (NC(=O)). These are key areas for modification.
4. **Action Space**: Replace or delete functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness.
5. **Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

### Suggested Modification:
Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a less drug-like group, such as a nitro group (NO2), which is less favorable for drug-likeness and will likely decrease QED.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the root molecule less drug-like and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties while maintaining structural similarity. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can:

1. Increase molecular weight by adding bulky groups.
2. Increase logP by adding hydrophobic groups.
3. Increase the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.
4. Disrupt aromaticity or introduce less favorable structural features.

Considering the structure of the root molecule `Cc1ccc(N[C@H](C)c2sc(C(C)(C)C)nc2C)c(C)[nH+]1`, we can target the following areas for modification:

- The aromatic ring (`c1ccc`): Introducing substituents that disrupt aromaticity or add bulk.
- The amide linker (`N[C@H](C)`): Modifying the linker to reduce hydrogen bonding potential.
- The thiazole ring (`c2sc`): Introducing less favorable or bulkier substituents.

Based on these considerations, the most effective modification to decrease QED while maintaining similarity would be to **replace the hydrogen atom on the nitrogen in the amide group with a bulky alkyl group** (e.g., isopropyl or tert-butyl). This will increase molecular weight, decrease hydrogen bonding potential, and slightly increase logP, all of which will reduce the QED score.

Here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydrogen atom on the nitrogen in the amide group with an isopropyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

The goal is to modify the **root_molecule** to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The current QED of the root molecule is **0.782504045542029**, so the target QED should be **≤ 0.682504045542029**.

To achieve this, I will focus on modifications that reduce drug-likeness, such as:
1. **Adding bulky or non-polar groups** to increase molecular weight or lipophilicity.
2. **Replacing hydrogen-bond donors or acceptors** with non-polar groups to reduce solubility.
3. **Introducing steric hindrance** to disrupt molecular interactions.
4. **Removing or replacing aromatic rings** to reduce planarity and complexity.

Given the structure of the molecule, I will target the **piperazine-like structure** (the six-membered ring with nitrogen) and the **aromatic rings** for modification, as these are key features contributing to drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
After considering the above reasoning, the top-1 suggestion is:

- **Replace the chlorine atom on the aromatic ring with a tert-butyl group.**

This modification increases steric hindrance and lipophilicity, reducing drug-likeness and QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the chlorine atom on the aromatic ring with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we can focus on modifying functional groups or atoms that significantly impact molecular properties like solubility, polarity, and size. The QED is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To lower the QED, we can introduce bulkier or less polar groups, remove hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or increase molecular weight or logP.

### Reasoning Process:
1. The root molecule contains a hydroxyl group, which is a hydrogen bond donor and contributes positively to QED. Replacing it with a bulkier or less polar group could reduce QED.
2. The molecule contains an ether linkage (OC[C@H](O)Cn1nnc2ccccc2c1=O), which is polar. Replacing this with a less polar group could decrease QED.
3. The molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which contributes to polarity. Modifying or replacing this group could impact QED.
4. Introducing a bulky or hydrophobic group could increase logP or molecular weight, both of which could lower QED.
5. The molecule contains a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (n1nnc2ccccc2c1). Modifying this ring could impact QED.

### Suggested Modifications:
1. Replace the hydroxyl group attached to the chiral carbon with a methyl group to remove hydrogen bonding potential and increase hydrophobicity.
2. Replace the ether linkage with a methylene group to reduce polarity.
3. Replace the carbonyl group with a methylene group to reduce polarity.
4. Add a chlorine atom to the aromatic ring to increase molecular weight and logP.
5. Replace one of the nitrogen atoms in the heterocycle with a carbon atom to reduce nitrogen content and polarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group attached to the chiral carbon with a methyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to consider modifications that introduce less desirable drug-like properties. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. Decreasing QED typically involves introducing features that are less favorable for drug-likeness, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or introducing rigid structures.

Given the structure of the root molecule \( CSc1nnc2n(N)cnn12 \), we can identify potential modifications:

1. **Adding a bulky group**: Introducing a bulky group like a phenyl ring can increase molecular weight and rigidity, reducing QED.
2. **Replacing sulfur with a less favorable atom**: Sulfur is often favorable in drug-like molecules. Replacing it with a less favorable atom like selenium could reduce QED.
3. **Adding a polar group**: Introducing a polar group like a hydroxyl group or carboxylic acid can increase polarity and decrease QED.
4. **Introducing a heterocycle**: Adding a heterocycle like pyridine could increase rigidity and polarity, reducing QED.
5. **Replacing nitrogen with a less favorable group**: Nitrogen is often favorable in drug-like molecules. Replacing it with a less favorable group like a nitro group could reduce QED.

Considering the guidelines, the best suggestion would be to **replace the sulfur atom with a selenium atom**, which should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfur atom with a selenium atom in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule, we need to make modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties of the molecule. Drug-like molecules typically have balanced hydrophobicity, molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and other physicochemical properties. To decrease QED, we can introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups excessively, or introducing steric hindrance.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding bulky groups or increasing the size of the molecule can decrease QED.
2. **Introduce Polar Groups**: Excessive polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carboxyl) can decrease QED by making the molecule too hydrophilic.
3. **Add Steric Hindrance**: Introducing bulky substituents can disrupt the molecule's drug-likeness by making it less flexible or more difficult to bind to targets.
4. **Disrupt Hydrogen Bonding**: Altering hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can reduce drug-likeness.

### Strategy:
To maintain similarity, we should target specific regions of the molecule for modification, rather than making sweeping changes. For example, modifying the terminal groups or adding substituents to aromatic rings can achieve the goal while keeping the core structure intact.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methyl group attached to the aromatic ring with a large hydrophobic group like a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by molecular properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we should introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, altering logP, or adding/removing polar functional groups.

2. **Strategy**: 
   - **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding larger or bulkier groups can decrease QED.
   - **Alter LogP**: Introducing more hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains) or removing polar groups can decrease QED.
   - **Modify Hydrogen Bonding**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED.
   - **Introduce Less Drug-like Features**: Adding unusual or less common functional groups can decrease QED.

3. **Action Space**: Based on the molecule's structure, we can target the amide group (`CC(=O)N`), the pyrrole ring (`[nH]`), or the piperazine ring (`N1CCC(N2CCOCC2)CC1`) for modification.

4. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

5. **Final Suggestion**: The most effective change would be to replace the amide group (`CC(=O)N`) with a more hydrophobic and bulkier ester group, which will decrease the molecule's drug-likeness.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining its similarity, we need to make modifications that typically reduce drug-likeness. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and the presence of specific functional groups. To lower the QED, we can:

1. **Increase hydrophobicity**: Adding hydrophobic groups or removing polar groups can decrease QED.
2. **Increase molecular weight**: Adding larger, non-polar groups can reduce QED.
3. **Introduce unfavorable functional groups**: Some functional groups are less desirable in drug-like molecules and can lower QED.

Given the structure of the root molecule, one plausible modification is to **replace the hydroxyl group with a methyl group**. This reduces polarity and introduces a hydrophobic group, which should decrease the QED. This modification also maintains the overall structure of the molecule, ensuring similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective Analysis**:  
   - The goal is to modify the molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule.
   - The current QED of the root molecule is 0.8493264930451827, so the target QED should be ≤ 0.7493264930451827.

2. **Molecule Analysis**:  
   - The root molecule contains a sulfoxide group (`[S@@](=O)`), a carbonyl group (`C(=O)`), a fluorinated benzene ring (`c1ccc(F)cc1F`), and a tetrazole ring (`c1nnnn1`).
   - Key features contributing to drug-likeness include the presence of hydrogen bond acceptors (fluorine, carbonyl, sulfoxide, tetrazole) and the overall molecular complexity.

3. **Modification Strategy**:  
   - To decrease QED, we need to reduce drug-like properties such as hydrogen bonding potential, lipophilicity, or molecular complexity.
   - Structural similarity can be maintained by modifying functional groups rather than altering the core scaffold.

4. **Action Space**:  
   - Add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups to achieve the desired QED reduction.

5. **Prioritized Modifications**:  
   - Replace the highly polar sulfoxide group (`[S@@](=O)`) with a less polar thioether (`S`) to reduce hydrogen bonding potential.
   - Replace the fluorinated benzene ring with a less polar aromatic ring (e.g., unsubstituted benzene) to decrease polarity.
   - Replace the tetrazole ring with a less polar heterocycle (e.g., thiazole) to reduce hydrogen bonding.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfoxide group with a thioether group to reduce polarity and hydrogen bonding potential."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **Key Considerations**:
   - The QED of the root molecule is 0.8168, so the goal is to reduce it to below 0.7168.
   - The molecule contains functional groups such as nitrile, carbonyl, and halogen atoms (chlorine and fluorine), which are common in drug-like molecules.
   - To decrease QED, we can introduce less drug-like features, such as larger or more hydrophobic groups, or reduce the presence of polar atoms.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Replace polar functional groups with less polar or bulky groups.
   - Introduce sterically hindering groups to reduce drug-likeness.
   - Reduce the number of hydrogen bond acceptors or donors.

4. **Action Plan**:
   - Focus on the nitrile group (C#N) and the carbonyl group (C=O) as they significantly contribute to the molecule's polarity and drug-likeness.
   - Replace the nitrile group with a less polar or more hydrophobic group.
   - Modify the carbonyl group to reduce its impact on QED.

5. **Specific Modification**:
   - Replace the nitrile group with an isopropyl group to introduce bulkiness and reduce polarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To address the task of decreasing the QED of the given molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-like properties. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and polar surface area. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify Functional Groups**: The molecule contains a carbonyl group, an amide group, and a heterocyclic ring system. These groups contribute to the molecule's drug-likeness.

2. **Modification Strategy**: To reduce QED, we can introduce less polar groups, increase molecular weight, or disrupt hydrogen bonding.

3. **Prioritize Changes**: The goal is to make minimal changes to maintain similarity while achieving the QED reduction. The amide group and the heterocyclic rings are key targets for modification.

4. **Consider Similarity**: We should avoid drastic changes that would alter the core structure significantly. Replacing or modifying functional groups that are not central to the molecule's scaffold is preferred.

Based on this reasoning, here is the top suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a less polar ester group to decrease hydrogen bonding potential and hydrophilicity."]
```

This change should decrease the QED by reducing the molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds, thereby lowering its drug-likeness. The ester group is less polar than the amide group, which aligns with the goal of reducing QED while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the root molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity. Based on the QED calculation, the molecule is already somewhat drug-like (QED = 0.786). To lower the QED, we can introduce modifications that increase molecular complexity, reduce solubility, or introduce unfavorable functional groups.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Reduce Solubility**: Introducing hydrophobic or bulky groups can decrease solubility, which typically lowers QED.
2. **Increase Molecular Complexity**: Adding sterically hindering groups or rings can reduce drug-likeness.
3. **Introduce Unfavorable Functional Groups**: Certain functional groups like nitro or sulfone groups are less common in drugs and can decrease QED.
4. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should be made to substructures that are not critical to the overall scaffold to preserve similarity.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Replace the hydroxyl group on the thiophene ring with a nitro group**: Nitro groups are less common in drugs and can significantly reduce QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the thiophene ring with a nitro group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The objective is to modify the `root_molecule` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while keeping the new molecules structurally similar to the original.

2. **Analyzing the Current Molecule**: The `root_molecule` has a complex structure with several functional groups, including a ketone, an amine, and a cyclic ether. These features contribute to its drug-like properties and high QED score.

3. **Strategies to Decrease QED**:
   - **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding bulkier groups can reduce QED.
   - **Introduce Less Polar Groups**: Replacing polar groups with non-polar groups can lower QED.
   - **Disrupt Planarity**: Adding steric hindrance can reduce drug-likeness.
   - **Increase Flexibility**: Introducing more rotatable bonds can decrease QED.

4. **Choosing a Modification Strategy**:
   - Replacing the ketone group with a less polar functional group (e.g., an alkene) is a feasible strategy. This modification reduces polarity and disrupts the planarity of the molecule, decreasing its QED while maintaining structural similarity.

5. **Final Suggestion**:
   - Replace the ketone group (carbonyl group) with a double-bonded carbon-carbon group (alkene) in the main chain of the molecule.

**final_suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ketone group with a double-bonded carbon-carbon group (alkene) in the main chain of the molecule."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule while maintaining structural similarity. Here's the reasoning process:

1. **Target Functional Groups**: The molecule contains several functional groups that contribute to its drug-likeness, such as carbonyl groups, amide groups, and hydroxyl groups. Modifying or removing these groups can decrease the QED.

2. **Structural Similarity**: To maintain similarity, we should avoid drastic changes like removing entire ring systems or altering the core scaffold. Instead, focus on modifying substituents or functional groups.

3. **QED Reduction**: To ensure a QED decrease of at least 0.1, we need to make changes that significantly impact the molecule's properties, such as increasing molecular weight or reducing polarity.

4. **Previous Experience**: The previous suggestion involved replacing the hydroxyl group with a hydrogen atom, which was effective. We should consider similar modifications but target different functional groups.

Given these considerations, the most effective modification would be to **replace the carbonyl group in the amide functional group with a methylene group**, as this will reduce the polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, thereby decreasing QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide functional group with a methylene group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The current QED of the root molecule is 0.704, so the target QED should be ≤ 0.604.

2. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as bulky groups, polar groups, or groups that disrupt aromaticity. However, the modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

3. **Action Space**: We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. Based on the structure of the root molecule, introducing polar or bulky groups in aromatic rings or replacing fragments with less drug-like features could be effective.

4. **Previous Experience**: From previous optimizations, polar or bulky modifications to aromatic rings or side chains often decrease QED significantly.

5. **Specific Modification**: One effective strategy is to introduce polar or bulky groups into the aromatic system, which can disrupt the drug-like properties.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
   
2. **Current QED**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.5056, and the target is to reduce it to below 0.4056 (0.5056 - 0.1).

3. **Strategies to Decrease QED**:
   - **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding larger or more complex functional groups can decrease QED.
   - **Increase Hydrophobicity**: Introducing hydrophobic groups or reducing polar groups can lower QED.
   - **Decrease Hydrogen Bond Acceptors/Donors**: Removing or replacing groups that contribute to hydrogen bonding can reduce QED.
   - **Increase Flexibility**: Adding rotatable bonds or bulky groups can decrease QED.

4. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should be minimal to ensure the new molecule remains structurally similar to the original.

5. **Previous Experience**: Based on the structure of the molecule and common strategies to decrease QED, replacing or adding hydrophobic groups or bulky substituents is likely to achieve the desired effect.

6. **Suggested Modification**: Replace the hydroxyl group in the molecule with a larger, more hydrophobic group such as a methoxy group or a tert-butyl group. This will increase the molecular weight and hydrophobicity, thus decreasing the QED significantly.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the given molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, I will consider modifications that reduce drug-like properties. This can be achieved by introducing less favorable structural features such as:

1. **Removing or altering the sulfonamide group**: The sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) is a common pharmacophore in drug molecules. Replacing it with a less favorable group, such as a simple methylene group, would decrease QED.
2. **Introducing a bulky or less polar group**: Adding a bulky group or reducing polarity can decrease QED. For example, replacing a hydrogen atom with a larger alkyl group could achieve this.
3. **Removing or altering the amide bond**: The amide bond (N-C=O) is a key feature in many drugs. Modifying or replacing this bond with a less favorable functional group, like an ester, could reduce QED.
4. **Introducing less favorable substitution patterns**: Fluorine atoms are often used in drug design to improve properties. Removing or replacing them with less favorable substituents, such as hydrogen or a bulky group, could decrease QED.

Based on these considerations, the top suggestion is:

**Replace the sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) with a simple methylene group (CH2).**

This modification is likely to decrease QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) with a simple methylene group (CH2)."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity. 

### Reasoning Process:
1. **QED Reduction**: To decrease the QED by at least 0.1, we need to introduce changes that make the molecule less favorable in terms of drug-likeness. This can be achieved by adding or modifying functional groups that are less common in drugs.
  
2. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to ensure it remains similar to the original molecule.

3. **Functional Group Changes**: Introducing bulky or less polar groups can reduce the QED. For example, adding a large alkyl chain or replacing a polar group with a non-polar one can decrease drug-likeness.

4. **Avoiding Drug-Like Features**: Removing or modifying groups that are commonly found in drugs, such as amides or aromatic rings, can also help in reducing the QED.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the above reasoning, the top suggestion is to replace one of the carbonyl groups with a less polar and bulkier group, such as a tert-butyl group, which is less common in drugs and will decrease the QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the five-membered ring with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we can consider the following reasoning:

1. **QED Reduction**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by various molecular properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we should introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, altering logP, or adding polar groups.

2. **Similarity Maintenance**: To maintain similarity, the modifications should be localized and not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule.

3. **Action Space**: Based on the guidelines, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. Given the structure of the molecule, adding bulky or polar groups could effectively decrease QED.

After considering these points, the top suggestion is:

**Add a nitro group to the phenyl ring adjacent to the sulfone group.**

This modification will increase the molecular weight and introduce additional polarity, both of which are likely to decrease QED significantly.

final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the phenyl ring adjacent to the sulfone group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To achieve this, we need to introduce changes that reduce drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

From the root molecule, we can identify key features that contribute to its drug-like nature, such as the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, carbonyl groups, and aromatic rings. To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that increase molecular weight, reduce polarity, or add less favorable functional groups.

#### Strategy:
1. **Increase Molecular Complexity**: Adding bulky groups or increasing the size of the molecule can reduce drug-likeness.
2. **Reduce Polarity**: Introducing hydrophobic groups or removing polar groups can decrease QED.
3. **Modify Functional Groups**: Replace or remove functional groups that are typically favorable in drug molecules (e.g., hydroxyl groups, amines).

### Suggested Modification
Replace the hydroxyl group with a less polar and less drug-like group such as a methoxy group. This change will reduce the polarity of the molecule and decrease its QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group with a methoxy group on the aromatic ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: Modify the root molecule (`CNc1ccc2nc(-c3ccc(F)c(F)c3F)[nH]c2n1`) to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 (current QED: 0.708201040864523).
2. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce changes that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. This can be achieved by:
   - Adding or modifying functional groups that decrease lipophilicity or increase molecular weight.
   - Introducing steric hindrance or polar groups that disrupt the molecule's favorable properties.
3. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should be minimal to keep the molecule structurally similar to the root molecule.
4. **Avoid Repeating Previous Suggestions**: Ensure the suggested modifications are unique and not repeated from previous prompts.

### Suggested Modifications:
- **Add a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring**: Introducing a hydroxyl group increases polarity and decreases lipophilicity, thereby reducing QED.
- **Replace a fluorine atom with a chlorine atom**: Chlorine is bulkier and less favorable for drug-likeness compared to fluorine.
- **Add a methyl group to the nitrogen atom in the imidazole ring**: This increases steric hindrance and reduces QED.
- **Replace the methyl group attached to the nitrogen with an ethyl group**: Increasing the size of the alkyl group decreases drug-likeness.
- **Add a nitro group to the aromatic ring**: Nitro groups are highly polar and decrease QED significantly.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the aromatic ring."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1 while keeping it structurally similar to the input molecule, we need to consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties without drastically altering the core structure. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. 

Based on the input molecule (`CCCCCOc1ccc(C(N)=S)cc1`), here are some potential strategies:

1. **Increase hydrophobicity**: Adding hydrophobic groups can decrease QED.
2. **Introduce large, bulky groups**: This can reduce drug-likeness by increasing molecular weight and steric hindrance.
3. **Remove or modify polar groups**: Polar groups like amines or thiols contribute to drug-likeness, so modifying or removing them can decrease QED.
4. **Introduce non-drug-like functional groups**: Groups that are uncommon in drugs can reduce QED.
5. **Disrupt aromaticity**: Aromatic systems are common in drugs, so disrupting aromaticity can decrease QED.

Considering similarity and the need to decrease QED by at least 0.1, the most promising strategy is to **introduce a large, bulky, and hydrophobic group** to the molecule. This modification will increase hydrophobicity and steric hindrance, both of which are likely to decrease QED significantly.

**Final Suggestion**:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the pentyl chain with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task step-by-step and reason through the modifications needed to achieve the goal:

### Goal:
- The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it "less like a drug" and **decrease its QED by at least 0.1** (from 0.7146 to below 0.6146).
- The modifications should **retain similarity** to the root molecule.

### Reasoning:
1. **QED Decrease**: To decrease QED, we need to reduce the molecule's "drug-likeness." This can be achieved by introducing features that are less favorable in drugs, such as:
   - Adding large hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains, phenyl rings).
   - Introducing polar or charged groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acids).
   - Increasing molecular complexity (e.g., adding rings or branches).
   - Removing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness (e.g., sulfonamides, amines).

2. **Retaining Similarity**: The modifications should focus on **minor changes** to the molecule's structure, such as replacing or adding small functional groups or atoms rather than making large-scale alterations.

3. **Avoiding Drug-Like Features**: Adding bulky or polar groups to the molecule will likely reduce its drug-likeness.

4. **Previous Experience**: Since no previous suggestions are provided, we can focus on structural modifications that are intuitive for reducing QED.

### Suggested Modifications:
1. **Replace the sulfonamide group with a bulkier and less polar group** (e.g., a substituted phenyl ring). This will reduce the molecule's polarity and make it less drug-like.
2. **Add a hydroxyl group to the cyclohexane ring**. This will increase hydrophilicity and disrupt the molecule's drug-likeness.
3. **Replace the ester group with a less polar and bulkier group** (e.g., a tertiary butyl group). This will reduce the molecule's polarity and drug-likeness.
4. **Introduce a carboxylic acid group to the phenyl ring**. This will increase hydrophilicity and reduce drug-likeness.
5. **Replace the dimethylamine group with a bulkier and less basic group** (e.g., a piperidine ring). This will reduce the molecule's drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the reasoning, the **top-1 suggestion** is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonamide group with a bulkier and less polar group, such as a substituted phenyl ring."]
```

This modification is expected to significantly decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule (CCNc1nc(-c2cc(Cl)cs2)nc(C)c1C(C)C) by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties of the molecule. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify Key Drug-like Features**: The molecule has several drug-like features, such as the pyrimidine ring (c1nc), the chlorine substituent, and the isopropyl group (C(C)C). These contribute to its high QED.

2. **Modifications to Decrease QED**:
   - **Replace Chlorine with a Bulky Group**: Chlorine is a common substituent in drugs, and replacing it with a bulkier, less drug-like group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) can decrease QED.
   - **Add Hydrophobic Groups**: Adding large hydrophobic groups (e.g., a phenyl ring) can decrease QED by making the molecule less polar and more lipophilic.
   - **Replace Amine with a Less Polar Group**: The ethylamine (CCN) group can be replaced with a less polar group (e.g., an ether or ester) to decrease QED.
   - **Introduce Steric Hindrance**: Adding bulky groups that introduce steric hindrance can disrupt the molecule's drug-like properties.

3. **Maintain Structural Similarity**: The modifications should be as minimal as possible to keep the molecule similar to the original structure.

Based on this reasoning, the top suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the chlorine atom with a tert-butyl group to introduce steric hindrance and decrease polarity."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

1. **Goal**: Modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **QED Reduction Strategy**: To reduce QED, we can make the molecule less drug-like by introducing features that are less favorable in drug molecules, such as increasing molecular weight, introducing polar groups, or reducing solubility.
3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity. Changes should focus on peripheral functional groups or minor substitutions.
4. **Previous Experience**: Avoid repeating previous suggestions and ensure the modifications are distinct.
5. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups.

### Suggested Modification
To reduce QED by at least 0.1, we can introduce a polar and less drug-like functional group. One effective strategy is to replace a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group, which is polar and can decrease QED. This modification is subtle enough to maintain structural similarity while making the molecule less drug-like.

### Final Suggestion
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease the QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **Key Considerations:**
   - **QED Reduction:** To decrease QED, we can introduce less favorable properties, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.
   - **Structural Similarity:** The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.
   - **Avoid Drug-like Features:** We can remove or modify functional groups typically associated with drug-likeness, such as amines, hydroxyl groups, or ethers.

3. **Potential Modifications:**
   - **Modification of the Ether Linkage:** Replace the ether oxygen with a less favorable group, such as a sulfur atom or a methylene group.
   - **Introduction of a Bulky Group:** Add a bulky alkyl or aromatic group to a side chain to decrease drug-likeness.
   - **Reduction of Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors:** Remove or replace the amine group with a non-polar group.

4. **Final Suggestion:**
   - **Replace the Ether Oxygen with a Methylene Group:** This modification reduces the drug-likeness by removing the polar ether linkage, which is a common feature in many drugs, and decreases QED by increasing hydrophobicity.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ether oxygen in the molecule with a methylene group to reduce drug-likeness and decrease QED."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we can consider modifying the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Understanding QED**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is a metric that combines several molecular properties, such as molecular weight, logP, number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we need to modify the molecule in a way that makes it less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, altering logP, or adding/removing functional groups that negatively impact drug-likeness.

2. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity. This means we should focus on peripheral changes rather than core structural changes.

3. **Possible Modifications**:
   - Adding bulky groups that are not typically found in drugs, such as long alkyl chains or large aromatic rings.
   - Introducing polar groups that are not favorable in drug molecules, like additional hydroxyl groups or carboxyl groups.
   - Removing or replacing functional groups that contribute positively to drug-likeness, such as replacing a methyl group with a larger, less favorable group.

4. **Specific Suggestion**: A reasonable modification would be to add a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring, which would increase the polarity and could negatively impact the QED.

Here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. Common strategies to achieve this include:

1. **Adding bulky or polar groups**: These can decrease drug-likeness by increasing molecular weight or polarity, which often reduces permeability and increases the likelihood of poor absorption.
  
2. **Removing or replacing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness**: For example, replacing amides or amines with less favorable groups can decrease QED.

3. **Increasing flexibility**: Adding rings or bulky groups that increase the molecule's flexibility can make it less drug-like.

4. **Introducing groups that disrupt molecular symmetry or planarity**: This can make the molecule less drug-like by reducing its ability to fit into biological targets.

Given the root molecule’s structure, we can target the amide groups (CNC(=O)) or the cyclic regions (e.g., CC23CC4CC(CC(C4)C2)C3) for modification. One effective way to decrease QED is to **replace the amide groups with less favorable functional groups**, such as esters or ethers, which typically have lower QED contributions.

**Reasoning Process**:
- The root molecule contains two amide groups (CNC(=O)), which are highly favorable for drug-likeness.
- Replacing one or both of these amide groups with less favorable functional groups (e.g., esters or ethers) can significantly decrease the QED.
- This modification maintains structural similarity while achieving the goal of reducing drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the amide groups (CNC(=O)) with an ester group (COO)."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of modifying the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider changes that generally reduce drug-likeness. This can be achieved by:

1. **Increasing molecular weight** (e.g., adding larger groups).
2. **Introducing less polar or hydrophobic groups** (e.g., adding aliphatic chains or aromatic rings).
3. **Reducing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors** (e.g., replacing polar groups with non-polar ones).

Given the structure of the root molecule, which contains a carbonyl group, an amide, a fluorine-substituted aromatic ring, and a sulfur-containing ring system, we can target modifications that increase hydrophobicity or complexity while reducing polarity.

### Reasoning Process:
- **Adding a large hydrophobic group**: This would increase molecular weight and reduce polarity, decreasing QED.
- **Replacing a polar group with a non-polar group**: This would reduce hydrogen bonding potential and decrease QED.
- **Introducing a sterically bulky group**: This would reduce drug-likeness by making the molecule less likely to bind to biological targets.

Based on the guidelines and the goal, the most effective suggestion is to **replace the fluorine atom on the aromatic ring with a bulky hydrophobic group**, such as a tert-butyl group. This modification increases hydrophobicity, reduces hydrogen bonding potential, and increases steric bulk, all of which decrease QED significantly.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluorine atom on the aromatic ring with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to consider modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify Drug-Like Features**: The molecule contains functional groups such as an amide, amine, and a branched alkyl chain, which contribute to its drug-like properties. Reducing the complexity or polarity of these groups can decrease the QED.

2. **Modify Functional Groups**: Replacing the amide group with a less polar group or altering the amine group to a less basic nitrogen-containing group can reduce drug-likeness.

3. **Structural Changes Without Drastic Alterations**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

4. **Previous Experience**: We should avoid repeating previous suggestions and focus on novel yet reasonable changes.

Based on this reasoning, the top-1 suggestion is:

**final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group to reduce polarity and drug-likeness."]**

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Understanding the Objective:** The goal is to modify the root molecule (`C[C@@H]1CN(C)c2nc3c(c(=O)[nH]c(=O)n3C)n2C1`) to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modifications should retain structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **Analyzing the Root Molecule:** The molecule contains a bicyclic structure with nitrogen and carbonyl groups, which are common in drug-like molecules. To decrease drug-likeness, we can reduce these features or introduce less favorable functional groups.

3. **Considering QED Factors:** QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) considers properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. Decreasing QED can be achieved by increasing molecular weight, logP, or introducing less favorable polar groups.

4. **Potential Modifications:** 
   - **Replace a carbonyl group with a less polar group (e.g., methylene).** This reduces polarity and potentially decreases QED.
   - **Delete a nitrogen atom in the ring.** This reduces hydrogen bond acceptor count and complexity.
   - **Add a bulky hydrophobic group.** This increases logP and molecular weight.
   - **Replace an amide with a less polar functional group.** This reduces hydrogen bonding potential.

5. **Selecting the Top Suggestion:** The most effective modification likely involves replacing a polar functional group with a less polar one to decrease the QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the carbonyl groups in the molecule with a methylene group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule.

2. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and polarity. To reduce QED, we can:
   - **Increase hydrophobicity** by adding non-polar groups.
   - **Increase molecular weight** by adding larger substituents.
   - **Introduce steric hindrance** or **reduce hydrogen bonding potential**.

3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule, focusing on peripheral changes that do not drastically alter the scaffold.

4. **Previous Experience**: Avoid repeating previous suggestions and focus on unique modifications.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Replace the fluorine atoms in the aromatic ring with larger, non-polar groups** such as **methyl groups**. This will increase hydrophobicity and molecular weight, thereby decreasing QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluorine atoms in the aromatic ring with methyl groups to increase hydrophobicity and molecular weight."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-like properties while maintaining structural similarity. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, polarity, and the presence of functional groups. To reduce QED, we can introduce modifications that increase molecular weight, decrease polarity, or add less drug-like functional groups.

Given the structure of the root molecule (CC(C)(CO[N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)Cl), we can consider the following strategies:

1. **Replace the nitro group (NO2) with a less polar group**: The nitro group is highly polar and contributes to drug-likeness. Replacing it with a less polar group like a methyl group or an ethyl group could reduce QED.
2. **Add a bulky group**: Adding a bulky group like a phenyl ring or a tert-butyl group can increase molecular weight and reduce QED.
3. **Remove or replace the chlorine atom**: Chlorine atoms are common in drug molecules. Replacing it with a less common atom or group could decrease drug-likeness.

Considering these strategies and the need to maintain similarity, the most effective modification would be to **replace the nitro group with a less polar group**.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a methyl group"]
```

This modification should reduce the QED by decreasing the polarity of the molecule while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original structure.

2. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less favorable in terms of drug-likeness. This could involve:
   - Introducing bulky or less polar groups.
   - Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.
   - Introducing functional groups that are less common in drugs.

3. **Key Considerations:**
   - The modification should not drastically alter the core structure to maintain similarity.
   - The modification should leverage the existing scaffold and functional groups to minimize changes.

4. **Action Plan:** Add a large, non-polar group to the molecule. This will decrease QED by increasing molecular weight and reducing polarity, making it less drug-like.

5. **Similarity:** The modification will be localized to minimize structural changes and maintain similarity to the original molecule.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a tert-butyl group to the aromatic ring with fluorine."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **QED Reduction Strategy**: To reduce QED, we can introduce less drug-like features such as increasing molecular weight, adding bulky groups, or introducing polar groups that are not typically favored in drug-like molecules.
3. **Similarity Consideration**: The modification should be minimal to ensure structural similarity to the root molecule. This means avoiding drastic changes like adding large rings or completely altering the core structure.
4. **Previous Experience**: Based on previous substructure changes, adding bulky or polar groups to the molecule, especially in positions that do not disrupt the core structure, is effective in reducing QED while maintaining similarity.

### Suggested Modification:
To achieve the desired QED reduction and maintain similarity, I suggest **adding a carboxyl group to the pyridine ring in the molecule**. This modification introduces a polar group that is less favored in drug-like molecules, thereby reducing the QED while keeping the core structure intact.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carboxyl group to the pyridine ring in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The task is to modify the given molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should still be similar to the original molecule.

2. **QED Considerations**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by various molecular properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, etc. To decrease QED, we can make changes that reduce drug-likeness, such as increasing molecular weight, introducing unfavorable functional groups, or altering the molecular structure in a way that reduces its drug-like characteristics.

3. **Molecular Similarity**: The modifications should retain structural similarity to the original molecule. This means changes should be minor, such as altering functional groups or replacing atoms without drastically changing the core structure.

4. **Action Space**: The modifications can include adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups. Given the constraints, the best approach is to replace functional groups or atoms with less drug-like alternatives.

5. **Previous Experience**: Based on previous knowledge, replacing a carbonyl group with a sulfonyl group or introducing a bulky substituent can decrease drug-likeness.

### Suggested Modification

- **Replace the carbonyl group in the amide linkage with a sulfonyl group**. This change will increase the molecular weight and introduce a less favorable functional group, thereby reducing the QED.

### Final Suggestion

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide linkage with a sulfonyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to consider modifications that generally reduce drug-likeness, such as introducing bulky or polar groups, removing key functional groups, or adding steric hindrance. The goal is to make the molecule less drug-like while ensuring the modifications do not drastically alter the core structure.

From the root molecule, we can identify key functional groups and substructures that contribute to its drug-likeness, such as the amide group, the nitrogen-containing rings, and the fluorine atom. To decrease QED, we can introduce less favorable groups (e.g., esters, halogens, or large aliphatic chains) or replace polar groups with less polar ones.

Here are potential actions:
1. Replace the amide group with an ester group to reduce hydrogen bonding potential.
2. Introduce a bulky substituent (e.g., a tert-butyl group) to increase steric hindrance.
3. Replace the fluorine atom with a larger halogen like iodine to disrupt molecular interactions.
4. Add a polar, but less drug-like group, such as a nitro group, to decrease QED.
5. Remove the secondary amine group and replace it with a less polar group like a methyl group.

The top suggestion for achieving the goal is to **replace the amide group with an ester group**, as this modification significantly reduces hydrogen bonding potential and drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should still be structurally similar to the input molecule.

2. **Current QED**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.5155514591462095. We need to reduce it to below 0.4155514591462095.

3. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we can make the molecule less drug-like by reducing its complexity, increasing its hydrophobicity, or introducing less favorable functional groups. However, we must maintain structural similarity to the input molecule.

4. **Target Areas**:
   - The molecule contains a cyclohexane ring, a nitro group, and an amine group. Modifying these parts could significantly impact QED.
   - Replacing the nitro group with a more hydrophobic or less polar group could reduce QED.
   - Adding bulky or non-polar groups to the cyclohexane ring or the benzene ring could also decrease QED.

5. **Proposed Modifications**:
   - Replace the nitro group with a methyl group to reduce polarity.
   - Add a chlorine atom to the benzene ring to increase hydrophobicity.
   - Replace the amine group with a methoxy group to reduce polarity and complexity.
   - Replace the cyclohexane ring with a cyclopentane ring to reduce size and complexity.
   - Add a methyl group to the cyclohexane ring to increase hydrophobicity.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:**  
   - Modify the given molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1.  
   - The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the original one.

2. **Analysis of the Molecule:**  
   - The molecule contains a nitrophenol group (`[N+](=O)[O-]`), a benzofuran-like structure, and an amide group (`C(=O)`).  
   - To decrease QED, we can introduce less drug-like features such as bulky groups, polar groups, or less favorable pharmacokinetic properties.  

3. **Potential Modifications:**  
   - Replace the nitro group (`[N+](=O)[O-]`) with a more polar or bulky group that disrupts drug-likeness.  
   - Introduce a less favorable functional group in place of the amide group.  
   - Add a sterically hindering group to reduce drug-likeness.  

4. **Optimization Criteria:**  
   - Ensure the modification reduces QED by at least 0.1.  
   - Maintain structural similarity to the original molecule.  

5. **Final Decision:**  
   - Replace the nitro group with a sulfonate group (`-SO3H`), which is more polar and less drug-like, likely decreasing QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.  

**Final Suggestion:**  
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a sulfonate group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-likeness. This can be achieved by adding bulky or less polar groups, introducing non-drug-like functional groups, or disrupting key pharmacophoric features. Here’s the reasoning:

1. **Add a Bulky Group**: Adding a large, non-polar group like a phenyl ring could reduce QED by increasing molecular weight and reducing solubility.
2. **Introduce a Polar Group**: Adding a highly polar but non-drug-like group, such as a sulfonic acid group, can decrease QED by making the molecule less drug-like.
3. **Remove or Modify Key Functional Groups**: Removing or modifying key functional groups like the amine or carbonyl group can reduce drug-likeness.
4. **Introduce a Non-Drug-Like Group**: Adding a group like a nitro group can reduce QED due to its non-drug-like properties.
5. **Increase Molecular Complexity**: Adding a complex, non-drug-like structure like a fused ring system can decrease QED.

Based on this reasoning, the top suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a phenyl group to the nitrogen atom of the amine group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that reduce the drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and the presence of certain functional groups. 

Given the structure of the root molecule, which contains a complex heterocyclic system with carbonyl groups, methoxy groups, and an imine, we can consider the following strategies:
1. **Introducing bulky groups**: This can increase molecular weight and reduce drug-likeness.
2. **Replacing polar groups with non-polar groups**: This can reduce hydrophilicity and lower QED.
3. **Breaking symmetry or introducing steric hindrance**: This can make the molecule less drug-like.

Based on these strategies, the top suggestion is to replace one of the methoxy groups with a non-polar, bulky substituent like a tert-butyl group. This modification will increase the molecular weight and reduce the molecule's polarity, thereby decreasing its QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one methoxy group with a tert-butyl group"]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to make modifications that reduce drug-likeness. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can:

1. **Increase molecular weight** by adding bulky groups, which often reduces drug-likeness.
2. **Introduce more hydrophobicity** (increase logP) by adding non-polar groups like alkyl chains or aromatic rings.
3. **Reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors**, as these are favorable for drug-likeness.
4. **Introduce steric hindrance or rigid structures**, which can reduce the molecule's ability to interact with biological targets.

Considering the root molecule `N#Cc1ccccc1NC(=O)CC[NH+]1C[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C1`, modifications could include:
- **Adding a hydrophobic group** (e.g., a phenyl ring) to increase logP.
- **Replacing a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor** (e.g., an oxygen or nitrogen) with a non-polar group.
- **Introducing a bulky substituent** to increase steric hindrance.

After analyzing the structure, a suitable modification would be to **replace the hydroxyl group on the cyclohexane ring with a phenyl group**. This change increases hydrophobicity and steric hindrance, which should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

Here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the cyclohexane ring with a phenyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the `root_molecule` by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-like properties. Typically, QED decreases with larger molecular weights, increased hydrophobicity, or the introduction of less common functional groups. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Reasoning**: 
   - The `root_molecule` contains a piperidine ring (`C1CCCCC1`), an amide group (`C(=O)NC`), and an ether linkage (`OCc2ccccn2`). To reduce QED, we can modify these functional groups or introduce less drug-like features.
   - Replacing the piperidine ring with a bulkier, less flexible group (e.g., a phenyl ring) can decrease QED by increasing hydrophobicity and rigidity.
   - Introducing a less common functional group (e.g., a nitro group or a sulfonyl group) can also reduce QED.

2. **Modification Strategy**:
   - Replace the piperidine ring (`C1CCCCC1`) with a phenyl ring (`C1ccccc1`) to increase hydrophobicity and rigidity.
   - This modification is expected to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity to the `root_molecule`.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The change involves replacing the 6-membered aliphatic ring with a 6-membered aromatic ring.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the piperidine ring (C1CCCCC1) with a phenyl ring (C1ccccc1)."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to consider modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. Drug-likeness is often associated with the presence of certain functional groups, such as sulfonamides, amides, and heterocycles. By altering or removing these groups, we can reduce the QED score while keeping the overall structure similar.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Identify Key Functional Groups**: The root molecule contains a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)), an amide group (NC(=O)), and a thiadiazole ring (c1nnc(NC(=O)...)s1). These groups contribute to its drug-likeness.
   
2. **Modify the Sulfonamide Group**: The sulfonamide group is a common feature in drugs. Modifying or replacing it can reduce drug-likeness. For example, replacing the sulfonamide group with a less polar or less hydrogen-bonding group could decrease the QED.

3. **Modify the Amide Group**: The amide group is another functional group that enhances drug-likeness. Converting it to a less polar or less hydrogen-bonding group, such as an ester or ether, might reduce the QED.

4. **Introduce Bulky or Lipophilic Groups**: Adding bulky or lipophilic groups can decrease the QED by making the molecule less soluble or less permeable, both of which are undesirable for drug-like molecules.

5. **Maintain Structural Similarity**: To ensure the modified molecule remains similar to the root molecule, we should avoid making drastic changes to the core structure, such as altering the thiadiazole ring or the benzene ring.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)) with a methylene group (CH2) to reduce polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, which will decrease the QED."]
```

This modification targets a key functional group that contributes to drug-likeness and is likely to reduce the QED by more than 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the given molecule by at least 0.1 while keeping the structure similar to the root molecule, we need to consider modifications that generally reduce drug-likeness. Based on the guidelines, the following reasoning process is applied:

1. **Reducing Drug-Likeness**: QED decreases when molecules deviate from drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or introducing less common functional groups.

2. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should retain the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity. This means avoiding drastic changes like removing large rings or altering the scaffold.

3. **Functional Group Modifications**: Introducing bulky or polar groups can significantly reduce QED. For example, adding a hydroxyl group or replacing a hydrogen with a larger functional group can achieve this.

4. **Avoiding Repetition**: The suggestion should not repeat any previous modification suggestions.

### Reasoning Steps:
- The root molecule contains an amide group, a thiophene ring, and a benzene ring. To reduce QED, we can introduce a polar group like a hydroxyl group or add a bulky substituent to the aromatic rings.
- Replacing a hydrogen atom with a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring can increase polarity and reduce QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with a hydroxyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: Modify the molecule `Cc1ccc(N2C[C@H](C(=O)NCCC(C)C)CC2=O)cc1C` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original structure.
2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.908992235314893, so the target QED should be ≤ 0.808992235314893.
3. **Strategy**:
   - To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that reduce drug-likeness, such as adding bulky groups, reducing polarity, or disrupting key pharmacophoric features.
   - The modifications should preserve the core structure (e.g., the aromatic ring and key functional groups) to maintain similarity.
   - Suggested changes should focus on functional groups or atoms that are likely to reduce QED significantly.
4. **Action**:
   - **Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) in the ring with a less polar group** (e.g., a methyl group). This reduces polarity and disrupts a key pharmacophoric feature, likely decreasing QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the ring with a methyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce changes that generally reduce drug-likeness. Some common strategies include:

1. **Adding bulkier or less polar groups**: This can decrease lipophilicity and make the molecule less drug-like.
2. **Introducing less common functional groups**: Groups that are less prevalent in drugs, such as nitro or sulfonyl groups, can reduce QED.
3. **Removing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors**: This can reduce the molecule's ability to interact with biological targets, decreasing QED.
4. **Increasing molecular weight or complexity**: Adding large substituents or rings can decrease drug-likeness.
5. **Introducing steric hindrance**: This can reduce the molecule's ability to bind to targets, lowering QED.

Given the structure of the root molecule, one effective way to decrease QED is to introduce a less common functional group that disrupts the drug-like properties. For example, replacing a hydrogen atom with a nitro group or adding a bulky substituent like a tert-butyl group could achieve this.

**Reasoning process**:
- The molecule contains an amide group, a common feature in drugs. Replacing the amide with a less drug-like functional group, such as a sulfonamide, could decrease QED.
- Adding a bulky group to the aromatic ring could also disrupt the molecule's drug-likeness.
- Introducing a nitro group, which is less common in drugs, could decrease QED while maintaining some structural similarity.

Based on this reasoning, the top suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a sulfonyl group to decrease drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce drug-like properties. The QED score is influenced by parameters such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To decrease QED, we can consider:

1. **Adding hydrophobic groups**: Increasing hydrophobicity can reduce the QED score.
2. **Increasing molecular weight**: Adding larger groups can decrease the QED.
3. **Introducing less polar or non-polar groups**: This can also reduce the QED.

Given the structure of the root molecule, we can target the ethyl group (CCO) or the methoxy group (OC) for modification.

**Reasoning Process**:
- The root molecule has a methoxy group attached to the aromatic ring. Replacing this with a more hydrophobic or bulky group can reduce the QED.
- The ethyl group (CCO) can be replaced with a longer alkyl chain to increase hydrophobicity and molecular weight.
- The hydroxyl group in the structure can be replaced with a less polar group.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group attached to the aromatic ring with a tert-butyl group."]
```

This modification will increase hydrophobicity and molecular weight, likely reducing the QED score by more than 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties while maintaining structural similarity. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Disrupt Drug-Likeness**: Drug-likeness is often associated with specific functional groups, hydrophobicity, and molecular weight. To decrease drug-likeness, we can introduce polar or bulky groups, remove aromaticity, or modify the hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

2. **Decrease QED**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors like molecular weight, logP, and the presence of certain functional groups. To decrease QED, we can increase molecular weight, introduce polar groups, or reduce the number of aromatic rings.

3. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule, so we should focus on subtle changes, such as adding or replacing functional groups.

4. **Consider Previous Suggestions**: Ensure that the new suggestions do not repeat previous modifications.

Based on these considerations, the following modification is suggested:

**Final Suggestion**:
- [Replace the nitro group with a sulfonic acid group on the benzene ring.]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we need to consider modifications that weaken drug-like properties, such as reducing polarity, introducing steric hindrance, or removing pharmacophoric features. Here’s how I approached this:

1. **Reducing Polarity**: Replace the amine group (NH) in the amide (NC(=O)) with a nonpolar group like a methylene group (CH2). This modification reduces hydrogen bonding potential, which is a key feature of drug-like molecules.

2. **Introducing Steric Hindrance**: Replace the methoxy group (OCH3) attached to the benzene ring with a bulky tert-butyl group. This change reduces the molecule's ability to interact efficiently with biological targets.

3. **Removing Pharmacophoric Features**: Replace the fluorine atoms (F) in the OC(F)F group with hydrogen atoms (H). Fluorine is often used in drug design to enhance binding affinity or metabolic stability, and removing it reduces drug-likeness.

4. **Disrupting Planarity**: Replace the oxygen atom in the ether (O) with a sulfur atom (S). Sulfur is less electronegative and can introduce conformational changes, reducing the molecule's ability to align with biological targets.

5. **Reducing Electron Density**: Replace the aromatic benzene ring with a non-aromatic cyclohexane ring. This change reduces the molecule's ability to participate in π-π stacking interactions, which are common in drug-target interactions.

After considering these options, the most effective modification is **replacing the methoxy group with a bulky tert-butyl group**, as it introduces steric hindrance and reduces the molecule's drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group attached to the benzene ring with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **QED Reduction**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that typically reduce drug-likeness, such as adding bulky groups, increasing hydrophobicity, or introducing less favorable functional groups.
3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule, such as the cyclohexane ring and the phenyl group, to ensure similarity.
4. **Action Space**: Possible actions include adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups in the molecule.

### Suggested Modification:
One effective way to reduce QED while maintaining structural similarity is to **replace the primary amino group with a bulkier and less drug-like group**, such as a tert-butyl group. This substitution increases steric hindrance and decreases polarity, both of which can lower the QED significantly.

### Final Suggestion:

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we can consider modifying specific functional groups or atoms that contribute to the drug-likeness of the molecule. The Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, polarity, hydrogen bonding, and solubility. Here are potential modifications that could decrease QED:

1. **Replace the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring with a more hydrophobic group** like a methyl group. This would reduce the hydrogen bonding capacity and increase hydrophobicity, potentially decreasing QED.
2. **Introduce a bulky, non-polar group** such as a tert-butyl group in place of a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring. This would increase the molecular weight and hydrophobicity, likely lowering QED.
3. **Remove the ether oxygen in the 1,4-dioxane ring** and replace it with a carbon atom to form a cyclohexane ring. This would reduce polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.
4. **Replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a methylene group**. This would decrease polarity and hydrogen bonding, both of which contribute to QED.
5. **Add a nitro group to the benzene ring**. This would increase the molecular weight and introduce a highly polar group, likely decreasing QED.

Among these options, the most effective modification to decrease QED while maintaining similarity would be to **replace the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring with a more hydrophobic group like a methyl group**.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: Modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original structure.
2. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less drug-like, such as:
   - Adding bulky or polar groups that reduce solubility or increase hydrophobicity.
   - Removing or replacing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness (e.g., hydroxyl groups).
   - Introducing steric hindrance or reducing hydrogen bonding potential.
3. **Targeted Changes**:
   - Replace the hydroxyl group (`OH`) on the cyclohexane ring with a less polar or bulkier group.
   - Modify the tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`) to a less favorable substituent for drug-likeness.
   - Add a halogen atom (e.g., chlorine, bromine) to increase molecular weight and hydrophobicity.

4. **Similarity Consideration**: Ensure the modifications do not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule, maintaining similarity to the original.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the cyclohexane ring with a chlorine atom."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties of the molecule while maintaining its overall structure. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Reduce Drug-Like Features**: Drug-like molecules often have specific features such as hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, aromatic rings, and balanced hydrophobicity. Disrupting these features can reduce QED.
2. **Modify Functional Groups**: Replacing or removing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness can help. For example, replacing an amide with a less polar group or adding bulky substituents can reduce QED.
3. **Introduce Less Favorable Substituents**: Adding groups that are less common in drugs (e.g., large aliphatic chains or non-aromatic rings) can decrease QED.
4. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure to ensure the molecule remains similar to the input.

Based on these considerations, here is the reasoning for the suggested modification:

- **Replace the Ester Group with a Less Polar Group**: The ester group (CCC(=O)OC) is a common feature in drug-like molecules. Replacing it with a less polar group, such as an ether or alkyl chain, can reduce the overall drug-likeness and decrease QED.

Here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ester group (CCC(=O)OC) with an ethyl group (CCC) to reduce polarity and decrease drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-like properties. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, polarity, solubility, and the presence of functional groups typically found in drugs. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness**: The root molecule contains a methoxy group (CO), an aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycle (n2ccnn2), and a protonated nitrogen (nH+). These groups often contribute positively to drug-likeness.

2. **Modify or remove functional groups that enhance drug-likeness**:
   - Replace the methoxy group with a less polar group, such as a methyl group, to reduce polarity.
   - Replace the protonated nitrogen with a neutral nitrogen or another group to reduce solubility and charge.
   - Modify the aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycle to a less drug-like structure.

3. **Ensure structural similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

Based on this reasoning, the top suggestion is:

**Replace the methoxy group with a methyl group.**

This modification reduces the polarity of the molecule while maintaining structural similarity, which should effectively decrease the QED by more than 0.1.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group with a methyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original structure, we need to consider modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. Here’s a step-by-step reasoning process:

1. **QED and Drug-likeness**: The QED score is a measure of drug-likeness. To decrease it, we should introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as adding large or hydrophobic groups, removing polar groups, or introducing steric hindrance.

2. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity. This means keeping the key functional groups and the overall scaffold intact.

3. **Potential Modifications**:
   - **Adding Hydrophobic Groups**: Introducing a large hydrophobic group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) can decrease the QED by making the molecule less soluble and more lipophilic.
   - **Replacing Polar Groups**: Replacing a polar group like the amide with a non-polar group (e.g., a methyl group) can reduce the QED.
   - **Introducing Steric Hindrance**: Adding a bulky group near a key functional group can decrease the QED by making the molecule less likely to bind to biological targets.

4. **Learning from Previous Experience**: Based on previous modifications, adding a large hydrophobic group or replacing a polar group with a non-polar group has proven effective in decreasing QED while maintaining structural similarity.

5. **Final Suggestion**: Based on the above reasoning, the most effective and straightforward modification would be to replace the amide group (-CONH-) with a non-polar group like a methyl group.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (-CONH-) with a methyl group (-CH3) to decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Approach**:
   - Reducing QED can be achieved by introducing less drug-like features, such as adding polar groups, increasing molecular weight, or introducing steric hindrance.
   - To maintain similarity, modifications should be made to peripheral or less critical parts of the molecule.
   - Functional groups or atoms should be added or replaced in a way that does not drastically alter the core structure.
3. **Previous Experience**:
   - Adding bulky groups or polar groups tends to decrease QED.
   - Modifying the terminal functional groups or adding substituents to the chain can achieve the desired effect without significantly altering the core structure.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the above reasoning, the top suggestion is to add a polar hydroxyl group to the terminal ethyl group, which would increase polarity and decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to the terminal ethyl group of the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-like properties. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, polarity, and the presence of functional groups. To achieve the desired decrease in QED, we can consider modifications such as replacing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups with non-polar ones, introducing bulky groups that increase molecular weight, or adding groups that reduce solubility.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Decrease Polarity/Hydrogen Bonding**: Removing or replacing polar functional groups (e.g., amides, nitriles) or hydrogen bond donors/acceptors will reduce the QED.
2. **Increase Lipophilicity**: Adding non-polar groups or aromatic rings will increase lipophilicity and decrease QED.
3. **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Adding large, non-polar substituents will increase molecular weight and reduce QED.
4. **Reduce Solubility**: Modifying the molecule to make it less soluble (e.g., replacing polar groups with hydrophobic ones) will decrease QED.
5. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should be subtle to ensure the new molecules remain structurally similar to the root molecule.

### Suggested Modification:
Replace the nitrile group (C#N) with a bulky, non-polar group such as a tert-butyl group. This will reduce polarity, increase lipophilicity, and decrease the QED score by more than 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitrile group with a tert-butyl group on the aromatic ring."]
```

This modification is expected to decrease the QED significantly while keeping the molecule similar to the original structure.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: To make the molecule less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule.
2. **Strategy**: To achieve this, I will focus on modifying functional groups or atoms in a way that reduces the drug-likeness. This can be done by:
   - Introducing less favorable groups for drug-likeness (e.g., large hydrophobic groups, bulky groups).
   - Removing or replacing polar groups that contribute to drug-likeness.
   - Adding or modifying groups that disrupt the overall balance of properties (e.g., size, polarity, flexibility).

3. **Considerations**:
   - The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.
   - The changes should specifically target reducing QED by more than 0.1.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Replace the carbonyl group in the ester functional group with a bulky hydrophobic group**. This will decrease the polarity and disrupt the balance of properties, reducing QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the ester functional group with a bulky hydrophobic group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The objective is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while ensuring the modified molecule remains structurally similar to the original.

2. **QED Reduction**: To decrease the QED, we should introduce modifications that are typically less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as adding bulky or less polar groups, reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or increasing molecular weight.

3. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity. Changes should focus on altering functional groups or side chains rather than the core scaffold.

4. **Previous Experience**: From previous suggestions, we have learned that modifying functional groups (e.g., replacing hydroxyl groups with larger or less polar groups) can effectively reduce QED without drastically altering the molecule's core structure.

5. **Action Space**: We will focus on replacing specific functional groups or adding less favorable groups to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the reasoning above, the top suggestion is to replace the hydroxyl group on the carbon chain with a larger and less polar group, such as a tert-butyl group, which is less favorable in drug-like molecules and will likely decrease the QED significantly.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the carbon chain with a tert-butyl group."]

ons) can decrease QED.  
- Adding a bulky alkyl or aromatic group can reduce drug-likeness.  
- Removing or replacing the hydroxyl group with a less polar group can also decrease QED.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the given molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce changes that reduce the drug-like properties of the molecule. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and polar surface area. To achieve a significant reduction in QED, we will modify the molecule by introducing less drug-like features, such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding bulky groups, or removing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness.

**Reasoning Process:**
1. **Increase Hydrophobicity:** Adding hydrophobic groups like alkyl chains can reduce QED by increasing logP.
2. **Remove Polar Groups:** Removing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED.
3. **Introduce Bulky Groups:** Adding bulky substituents can reduce QED by increasing molecular weight and steric hindrance.
4. **Reduce Heteroatoms:** Replacing heteroatoms with carbon can decrease QED by reducing hydrogen bonding potential.

Based on these strategies, the top suggestion to reduce QED while maintaining structural similarity is to **replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a methylene group**. This modification removes a hydrogen bond acceptor and increases hydrophobicity, which should significantly reduce the QED.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a methylene group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Reduce Hydrogen Bond Acceptors/Donors**: Modifying or replacing functional groups that contribute to hydrogen bonding (e.g., amide, ether) can decrease QED.
2. **Increase Molecular Weight or Hydrophobicity**: Adding bulky or hydrophobic groups can reduce QED.
3. **Remove or Modify Aromatic Rings**: Aromatic rings are often associated with drug-likeness, so altering them can decrease QED.
4. **Introduce Steric Hindrance**: Adding groups that introduce steric hindrance can reduce drug-likeness.

Here’s the top suggestion based on the above reasoning:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a less polar ester group to reduce hydrogen bonding potential."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties while maintaining structural similarity. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Disrupt Pharmacophoric Features**: Drug-like molecules often contain specific functional groups like amides, amines, or aromatic rings. Modifying these groups can reduce drug-likeness.
2. **Increase Molecular Weight or Hydrophobicity**: Adding bulky or hydrophobic groups can decrease QED.
3. **Introduce Polarity or Charge**: Introducing polar or charged groups can disrupt drug-likeness.

Given the structure of the root molecule, a feasible modification would involve altering the amide functional group (NC(=O)) since it is a key pharmacophoric feature. Replacing it with a less drug-like group, such as an ester or a less polar group, could achieve the desired effect.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with an ester group (OC(=O)) in the molecule."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: Decrease the QED by at least 0.1 while keeping the molecule similar to the input molecule.
2. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED is influenced by factors like molecular weight, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To reduce QED, we can introduce features that decrease drug-likeness, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or introducing less common functional groups.
3. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should target regions of the molecule that are less critical to its core structure to maintain similarity.
4. **Suggestion**: Replace a hydrogen atom in the aromatic rings with a more polar or bulky functional group, such as a nitro group or a sulfonamide group, to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom in the aromatic ring with a nitro group to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. This can be achieved by introducing or altering functional groups in a way that disrupts favorable drug-like properties, such as polarity, solubility, or hydrogen bonding potential.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Target Functional Groups**: The molecule contains amide, ester, and hydroxyl groups, which are common in drug-like molecules. Modifying these groups can reduce QED.
2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: Introducing less polar or hydrophobic groups, or removing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, can decrease QED.
3. **Molecular Complexity**: Simplifying the structure (e.g., removing cyclic groups) can also reduce QED.
4. **Specific Changes**:
   - Replace the hydroxyl group with a less polar group like a methyl group.
   - Replace the ester group with a less polar group like an ether.
   - Remove the amide group and replace it with a simpler alkyl chain.

Considering similarity, we should focus on changes that do not drastically alter the overall structure of the molecule.

final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the cyclopentane ring with a methyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original structure, we need to modify the molecule in a way that makes it less drug-like. This can be achieved by introducing less favorable drug-like properties such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding steric hindrance, or reducing hydrogen bonding potential. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Increasing Hydrophobicity:** Adding a hydrophobic group like an alkyl chain can decrease the QED.
2. **Adding Steric Hindrance:** Introducing bulky groups can reduce the drug-likeness.
3. **Reducing Hydrogen Bonding:** Removing or replacing polar groups like amides or esters with less polar groups can decrease the QED.

Based on these strategies, the most effective modification would be to introduce a bulky, hydrophobic group that disrupts the overall drug-like properties of the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the given molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to modify functional groups or atoms in a way that reduces drug-likeness. QED is influenced by properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and polarity. To reduce QED, we can introduce less drug-like features such as larger hydrophobic groups, reduce hydrogen bonding potential, or increase steric hindrance.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Reduce Hydrogen Bonding Potential**: Removing or replacing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors (e.g., hydroxyl groups, amines) can decrease QED.
2. **Increase Hydrophobicity**: Adding large hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains, aromatic rings) can lower QED.
3. **Introduce Steric Hindrance**: Adding bulky groups can reduce QED by making the molecule less drug-like.
4. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically change the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Action**: Replace the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring with a methyl group. This reduces hydrogen bonding potential and increases hydrophobicity, which should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we need to consider modifications that reduce drug-likeness. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To decrease QED, we can introduce less favorable drug-like features, such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding bulky groups, or introducing non-drug-like functional groups.

Here's the reasoning process:
1. **Add Bulky Groups**: Adding bulky groups can reduce drug-likeness by increasing steric hindrance and reducing solubility.
2. **Replace Polar Functional Groups**: Replacing polar groups with less polar or non-polar groups can decrease drug-likeness.
3. **Introduce Non-Drug-Like Functional Groups**: Adding groups that are uncommon in drugs, such as nitro groups or long aliphatic chains, can reduce QED.

Considering these points, the top suggestion would be to **replace the amide group (O=C-N) with a less polar and bulkier group**, such as a thiocarbonyl group (C=S). This modification increases hydrophobicity and steric hindrance, which should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (O=C-N) with a thiocarbonyl group (C=S)."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** Modify the `root_molecule` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining molecular similarity.

2. **Understanding QED:** QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by various properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and aromaticity. Decreasing QED often involves introducing less drug-like features like increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or disrupting aromatic systems.

3. **Analyzing `root_molecule`:** The molecule contains an amide group, aromatic rings (phenyl and substituted phenyl), and a cyclic structure with a hydroxyl group. To decrease QED, we can introduce less favorable modifications like adding bulky groups, increasing hydrophobicity, or disrupting the aromatic system.

4. **Maintaining Similarity:** The modifications should not drastically change the core structure. Thus, minor changes like replacing a hydrogen with a larger group or adding a small functional group to the aromatic ring are preferred.

5. **Avoiding Repetition:** Ensure that the suggested modifications are unique and have not been suggested before.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the cyclohexane ring with a tert-butyl group to increase hydrophobicity and bulkiness."]
``` 

This modification increases the molecular weight and hydrophobicity, which are likely to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce drug-like properties. QED is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, polarity, hydrogen bonding, and aromaticity. To achieve the goal, we can consider the following strategies:

1. **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding bulky groups to the molecule can reduce QED by making the molecule less drug-like.
2. **Increase Polarity**: Introducing polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carboxyl) can decrease QED by making the molecule less lipophilic.
3. **Disrupt Aromaticity**: Reducing aromaticity or introducing non-aromatic rings can lower QED.
4. **Introduce Hydrogen Bond Acceptors/Donors**: Adding hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED by increasing the complexity of hydrogen bonding.
5. **Introducing Non-Classical Functional Groups**: Adding unusual or non-classical functional groups can reduce drug-likeness.

Given the structure of the root molecule, the most effective approach might be to introduce polar groups or disrupt aromaticity while maintaining similarity to the original structure.

**Reasoning Process**:
- The molecule contains an aromatic pyrazole ring and a benzene ring. Disrupting the aromaticity of one of these rings could significantly decrease QED.
- Introducing a polar group like a hydroxyl or carboxyl group on the benzene ring could also decrease QED by increasing polarity.
- Adding a bulky non-polar group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) could also reduce QED by increasing molecular weight and reducing solubility.

**Final Suggestion**:
Based on the above reasoning, the top suggestion is to disrupt the aromaticity of the benzene ring by converting it into a non-aromatic cyclohexane ring. This modification will reduce the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the aromatic benzene ring with a non-aromatic cyclohexane ring."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like. This can be achieved by altering functional groups or adding/substituting atoms in a way that reduces favorable drug-like properties such as solubility, stability, or bioavailability. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify Key Functional Groups**: The root molecule contains a pyrrolopyrimidine core, an amide group, and a methylated pyridine ring. These groups contribute to its drug-like properties.
2. **Modifications to Reduce Drug-Likeness**:
   - Adding bulky or hydrophobic groups can decrease solubility and QED.
   - Replacing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors with non-polar groups can reduce drug-likeness.
   - Introducing steric hindrance or less favorable geometries can disrupt binding potential.
3. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should target peripheral groups rather than the core structure to preserve similarity.

Based on this reasoning, the top suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a methylene group to reduce polarity and hydrogen bonding potential."]

2. **Increase hydrophobicity**: Increasing logP by adding hydrophobic groups (e.g., methyl or ethyl groups) can decrease QED.
3. **Increase molecular weight**: Adding bulky groups can increase the molecular weight and reduce drug-likeness.
4. **Introduce steric hindrance**: Adding bulky groups at key positions can disrupt the molecule's bioavailability and decrease QED.
5. **Modify aromaticity**: Reducing aromaticity or introducing non-aromatic rings can decrease drug-likeness.

Based on the structure of the root molecule, a suitable modification would be to **replace the methoxy group with a bulky hydrophobic group like a tert-butyl group**, which will increase hydrophobicity and steric hindrance, thereby decreasing QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group on the benzene ring with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-like properties. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To lower the QED, we can:

1. Increase hydrophobicity by adding non-polar groups.
2. Reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors by replacing polar groups with non-polar ones.
3. Increase molecular weight excessively, which can reduce drug-likeness.

Here’s the reasoning:

- The root molecule contains a thiophene ring, an amide group, and a carbonyl group, which are polar and contribute to its drug-like properties.
- To decrease QED, we can replace the carbonyl group (which is polar and contributes to hydrogen bonding) with a non-polar group like a methylene group.
- This modification reduces the polarity and hydrogen bond acceptor count, which should decrease the QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:

final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a methylene group to reduce polarity and hydrogen bonding capability."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the root molecule, we need to consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties of the molecule. Drug-like molecules often have specific features such as aromatic rings, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and balanced hydrophobicity. To decrease the QED, we can:

1. **Disrupt aromaticity**: Aromatic rings are a key feature of many drugs. Removing or altering aromaticity can decrease drug-likeness.
2. **Introduce bulky groups**: Adding bulky groups can decrease the molecule's ability to bind to biological targets, reducing drug-likeness.
3. **Remove hydrogen bond donors/acceptors**: These groups are crucial for interactions with biological targets. Removing them can decrease QED.
4. **Introduce polar groups inappropriately**: Adding polar groups in a way that disrupts the molecule's overall balance can decrease QED.
5. **Replace key functional groups with less drug-like ones**: For example, replacing an amine group with a less polar or more sterically hindered group.

Given the root molecule `Nc1nc(Cc2nc3ccc(Br)cc3s2)cs1`, we should focus on modifications that disrupt the aromatic system, remove or replace key functional groups, or introduce bulky groups.

**Reasoning Process**:
- The molecule has two aromatic rings connected by a chain containing nitrogen and sulfur atoms.
- The presence of the amine group (`Nc1`) and the bromine atom (`Br`) are key features that can be targeted for modification.
- To decrease QED, we can replace the amine group with a less polar group or introduce a bulky group that disrupts the molecule’s balance.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amine group attached to the first aromatic ring with a methyl group to reduce polarity and disrupt hydrogen bonding capability."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that reduce drug-likeness. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) score is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and topological polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can modify the molecule in ways that make it less drug-like, such as:

1. **Reducing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors or donors** by replacing functional groups that contribute to these properties.
2. **Increasing molecular weight** by adding bulky groups, which can reduce drug-likeness.
3. **Modifying logP** by introducing less polar or more hydrophobic groups.
4. **Decreasing the flexibility** of the molecule by reducing the number of rotatable bonds.

Considering the structure of the root molecule (O=C(CN1C(=O)CCC1=O)NCCc1ccccc1), we can focus on modifying the amide or ketone groups, which are key contributors to hydrogen bonding. Additionally, we can introduce bulkier groups or reduce the number of polar functional groups.

**Reasoning Process:**
- The molecule contains two carbonyl groups (C=O) and an amide group, which are polar and contribute to hydrogen bonding. Modifying these groups can reduce the drug-likeness.
- Introducing a bulky group, such as a phenyl ring or a large aliphatic chain, can increase molecular weight and reduce QED.
- Replacing the amide group with a less polar functional group, such as an ether, can reduce hydrogen bonding and decrease QED.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (CONH) with an ether group (CO) to reduce hydrogen bonding and decrease QED."]
``` 

This modification maintains similarity to the original molecule while reducing drug-likeness by decreasing the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors and increasing hydrophobicity.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original structure.

2. **Understanding QED:** QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by molecular properties such as molecular weight, logP, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, and the number of rotatable bonds. To decrease QED, we should alter these properties in a way that makes the molecule less drug-like.

3. **Similarity Considerations:** The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the root molecule, meaning we should avoid drastic changes like introducing completely new rings or long aliphatic chains.

4. **Potential Modifications:**
   - Introducing a less drug-like functional group, such as a nitro group (which is polar and can increase molecular weight).
   - Replacing a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor with a non-polar group.
   - Increasing the molecular weight by adding a bulky, non-polar substituent.
   - Reducing the number of rotatable bonds by rigidifying part of the molecule.
   - Introducing steric hindrance to reduce the molecule’s ability to interact with biological targets.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring with a nitro group to increase polarity and molecular weight, thereby decreasing drug-likeness."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule by at least 0.1 while keeping it structurally similar, we need to make strategic modifications that reduce drug-like properties. A decrease in QED can be achieved by introducing features that are less desirable in drugs, such as:

1. **Adding polar or hydrophilic groups** that may reduce membrane permeability.
2. **Introducing sterically bulky groups** that could hinder binding to biological targets.
3. **Modifying functional groups** to less favorable ones for drug-like properties (e.g., replacing amides with esters).

Given the structure of the molecule, we can focus on modifying the amide or ether linkages, adding polar groups, or introducing bulky substituents. Here’s the reasoning for the top suggestion:
- Replacing one of the amide groups with an ester group is likely to decrease QED without drastically altering the overall structure.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (C(=O)N) with an ester group (C(=O)O) in the molecule."]
``` 

This modification reduces hydrogen bonding potential and slightly increases hydrophilicity, which should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the given molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-like properties. Drug-like properties are often associated with features such as hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, lipophilicity, molecular weight, and polar surface area. To achieve this, we can consider the following strategies:

1. **Reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors**: Removing or replacing functional groups that contribute to hydrogen bonding (e.g., amides, amines) with less polar groups will decrease drug-likeness.
2. **Increase lipophilicity**: Adding hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains) can reduce QED.
3. **Increase molecular weight or complexity**: Adding bulky groups or rings can make the molecule less drug-like.
4. **Remove aromatic rings**: Aromatic rings often contribute to drug-likeness, so reducing their number can lower QED.
5. **Introduce steric hindrance**: Adding sterically bulky groups can reduce drug-likeness.

Given the structure of the molecule (O=C(NCCNC(=O)c1ccccc1)Nc1ccccc1), which contains two aromatic rings and amide groups, we can modify it by replacing one of the amide groups with a less polar group or adding hydrophobic substituents to the aromatic rings.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (C(=O)N) attached to the aromatic ring with a methylene group (-CH2-)."]

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the `root_molecule` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The QED of the root molecule is 0.766, so the modified molecule should have a QED < 0.666.

2. **Considerations**:
   - The molecule contains a benzimidazole-like core (`c1noc(C)c1`), a secondary amide (`C(=O)N`), and a piperazine-like moiety (`CN(C)C`).
   - To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less desirable in drug-like molecules, such as larger hydrophobic groups, polar groups that disrupt hydrogen bonding, or functional groups that increase molecular complexity without improving drug-likeness.
   - The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure to maintain similarity.

3. **Suggestions**:
   - Replace the secondary amide (`C(=O)N`) with a less drug-like group, such as an ester or a sulfonamide, which typically lowers QED.
   - Introduce a large hydrophobic group (e.g., a bulky alkyl or aryl group) to disrupt the molecule's balance of properties.
   - Add a polar group (e.g., a nitro group) in a position that disrupts hydrogen bonding or increases molecular polarity excessively.
   - Replace the piperazine-like moiety (`CN(C)C`) with a less drug-like cyclic amine or a non-cyclic hydrophobic amine.
   - Introduce a heteroatom (e.g., sulfur) in place of a carbon atom to increase molecular complexity without improving drug-likeness.

4. **Reasoning**: Among these options, replacing the secondary amide with a sulfonamide is likely to decrease QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity. Sulfonamides are less common in drug-like molecules due to their higher molecular weight and lower hydrogen-bonding potential.

5. **Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the secondary amide group (C(=O)N) with a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N)."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let’s break down the task and reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the root molecule (`CCCC(=O)Nc1cccc[n+]1Cc1ccccc1`) to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 (from 0.818 to below 0.718). The output molecules should remain similar to the input molecule.

2. **Approach**:
   - To decrease QED, we need to reduce the molecule's drug-likeness. This can be achieved by introducing unfavorable features for drug-likeness, such as:
     - Adding bulky or nonpolar groups.
     - Introducing highly polar or charged groups.
     - Disrupting the structural balance (e.g., breaking conjugation or adding steric hindrance).
   - The modifications should preserve the overall structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

3. **Suggestions**:
   - **Add a nitro group**: Nitro groups are highly polar and can decrease QED significantly.
   - **Replace the aromatic ring with a non-aromatic ring**: This disrupts conjugation and reduces drug-likeness.
   - **Add a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring**: This introduces polarity and hydrogen bonding, reducing QED.
   - **Replace the phenyl ring with a cyclohexyl ring**: This removes aromaticity and increases hydrophobicity.
   - **Add a second charged nitrogen group**: This increases polarity and charge density, reducing QED.

4. **Final Suggestion**:
   - After considering the goal and guidelines, the top suggestion is to **add a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring**, as it introduces polarity while maintaining structural similarity.

Here’s the `final_suggestion` list:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring in the root molecule."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the input molecule (`COc1ccc(-c2cc(C(=O)Nc3nc4c(s3)CCCC4)no2)cc1OC`) to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The output molecules should still be similar to the input molecule.

2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the input molecule is 0.7156813097788347. To decrease it by more than 0.1, the modified molecule should have a QED of less than 0.6156813097788347.

3. **Modification Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce changes that typically reduce drug-likeness, such as increasing molecular weight, adding bulky groups, or introducing less favorable functional groups.

4. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

5. **Action Space**: The modifications should involve adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups.

### Suggested Modification:

- **Replace the methoxy groups (OCH3) with larger, less drug-like groups**: The input molecule has two methoxy groups attached to the benzene ring. Replacing these with bulkier groups like tert-butyl or benzyl groups can decrease QED and make the molecule less drug-like while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace both methoxy groups attached to the benzene ring with tert-butyl groups."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The goal is to make the molecule less like a drug and decrease the QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **QED Consideration:** The QED of the root molecule is 0.798, so the target QED after modification should be less than 0.698.

3. **Modification Strategy:** To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are less drug-like. This can be achieved by:
   - Adding large, bulky groups that reduce bioavailability.
   - Introducing polar or charged groups that may reduce membrane permeability.
   - Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.

4. **Structural Similarity:** The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity. We will focus on modifying peripheral groups.

5. **Previous Experience:** From previous experiences, adding hydrophobic or bulky groups tends to decrease QED significantly. Replacing a hydrogen bond donor with a non-hydrogen bonding group can also reduce QED.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the cyclopentane ring with a tert-butyl group to decrease QED and maintain structural similarity."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. We can achieve this by either introducing less desirable functional groups or by disrupting the molecular symmetry, hydrogen bonding, or lipophilicity. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Increase Lipophilicity**: Introducing more hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains) can reduce QED, as excessive lipophilicity is generally undesirable in drug-like molecules.
2. **Disrupt Hydrogen Bonding**: Removing or replacing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors (e.g., replacing an amide with an ester) can reduce QED.
3. **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Adding bulky groups can decrease the molecule's drug-likeness by reducing its solubility or bioavailability.
4. **Remove Aromaticity**: Disrupting aromatic rings or replacing them with aliphatic structures can lower QED.

Based on these strategies, the top-1 suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group while keeping the rest of the molecule unchanged."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
  
2. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and polarity. To decrease QED, we can introduce less favorable drug-like properties, such as increasing hydrophobicity/rigidity, reducing hydrogen bonding potential, or disrupting the molecular framework.

3. **Maintaining Similarity**: To ensure the modified molecule remains similar to the root molecule, we will focus on minimal changes, such as replacing or adding functional groups, rather than altering the core structure.

4. **Action Plan**: Based on the $action_space, the strategy will involve replacing functional groups or atoms to achieve the QED reduction. Specifically, we will target modifications that reduce hydrogen bonding, increase molecular weight, or introduce less favorable structural elements.

5. **Modification Suggestion**: Replace the amide group (which contributes to hydrogen bonding and polarity) with a less polar and less hydrogen-bonding functional group, such as an ester.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. Drug-like molecules typically have specific properties such as balanced hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, appropriate molecular weight, and a limited number of certain functional groups. To reduce QED, we can:

1. **Increase hydrophobicity**: Adding large hydrophobic groups or removing polar groups can decrease QED.
2. **Increase molecular weight**: Adding larger substituents or extending the molecule can reduce QED.
3. **Introduce steric hindrance**: Adding bulky groups can make the molecule less drug-like.
4. **Remove hydrogen bond donors/acceptors**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED.
5. **Introduce less common functional groups**: Adding functional groups that are less common in drugs can reduce QED.

Considering the structure of the root molecule `C[C@H]1CC[NH2+]C[C@@H]1NC(=O)N[C@@H]1CCOC1`, we can modify it by introducing a bulky hydrophobic group or removing a polar group to decrease QED.

**Final suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group in the ethylene glycol moiety (CCO) with a methyl group to reduce polarity and increase hydrophobicity."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal Analysis**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The current QED of the root molecule is 0.785, so the new QED should be less than 0.685.

2. **Strategy for Decreasing QED**: To decrease QED, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness. This can be achieved by:
   - Introducing less favorable functional groups (e.g., polar groups, bulky groups).
   - Removing or altering key features that contribute to drug-likeness (e.g., reducing lipophilicity, increasing molecular weight, decreasing solubility).

3. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule, ensuring that the new molecule remains structurally similar to the root molecule.

4. **Actionable Suggestions**:
   - **Add a polar group**: Introducing a polar group like a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group can decrease QED.
   - **Increase steric hindrance**: Adding a bulky group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) can reduce drug-likeness.
   - **Remove a nitrogen atom**: Reducing the number of nitrogen atoms can decrease basicity and drug-likeness.
   - **Introduce a charged group**: Adding a charged group (e.g., an ammonium ion) can decrease QED.
   - **Increase hydrophobicity**: Adding a hydrophobic group (e.g., a long alkyl chain) can reduce drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion**:
Based on the analysis, the most effective suggestion to achieve the goal is to introduce a polar group into the molecule, which will decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen atom in the cyclic amine ring."]

AI Suggestion 0: Let’s break this task down step by step:

### Goal:
- Modify the input molecule (`COc1ccc(C2(CNS(=O)(=O)/C=C/c3ccccc3)CCCC2)cc1`) to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1.
- The modified molecules should remain structurally similar to the input molecule.
- Provide 5 new SMILES strings based on the modification.

### Key Considerations:
1. **QED Reduction**: To decrease QED by at least 0.1, we need to make the molecule less drug-like. This can be achieved by:
   - **Adding large or hydrophobic groups** (e.g., bulky alkyl chains, aromatic rings).
   - **Removing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, amine, or sulfonamide).
   - **Introducing features that reduce solubility or increase molecular weight**.
   
2. **Structural Similarity**: The modified molecule should retain the core structure of the input molecule to maintain similarity. Focus on modifying peripheral groups rather than the core framework.

3. **Action Space**:
   - **Add**: Introduce new atoms or functional groups.
   - **Delete**: Remove atoms or functional groups.
   - **Replace**: Swap atoms or functional groups.

4. **Constraints**:
   - Do not repeat previous suggestions.
   - Avoid abbreviations in the modification instructions.

---

### Reasoning and Suggested Modifications:
To achieve the QED reduction while maintaining structural similarity, here are the top modifications:

1. **Replace the sulfonamide group with a larger hydrophobic group** (e.g., a tert-butyl group): This will reduce polarity and increase hydrophobicity, thereby lowering QED.
2. **Add a bulky alkyl chain to the aromatic ring**: This will increase molecular weight and hydrophobicity, reducing QED significantly.
3. **Replace the methoxy group with a non-polar group** (e.g., a methyl group): This eliminates a polar functional group, reducing drug-likeness.
4. **Introduce a halogen (e.g., chlorine) on the aromatic ring**: This increases molecular weight and hydrophobicity without drastically changing the core structure.
5. **Replace the ethylene linker with a longer hydrophobic chain** (e.g., a propylene linker): This increases flexibility and hydrophobicity.

---

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the reasoning above, the top suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonamide group with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the given molecule by at least 0.1, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-like properties while maintaining structural similarity. Here’s how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Drug-like Features**: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group, an aromatic ring, and a fluorine atom, which are common in drug molecules. 
2. **Modify Functional Groups**: Reducing the drug-likeness can involve altering or removing functional groups that contribute to drug-like properties.
3. **Increase Molecular Complexity**: Adding bulky or non-drug-like groups can decrease QED.
4. **Maintain Similarity**: Modifications should not drastically change the core structure to maintain similarity.

Given these points, one effective strategy is to replace the sulfonamide group (`S(=O)(=O)`) with a less drug-like group, such as a thioether (`S`). This modification reduces the polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, which are key factors in drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion

final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonamide group with a thioether group."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by molecular properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To reduce QED, we can:
   - Increase molecular weight or logP.
   - Add hydrophobic groups or remove polar groups.
   - Introduce bulky groups that reduce solubility.
3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.
4. **Previous Experience**: Based on previous modifications, adding hydrophobic or bulky groups tends to reduce QED effectively.
5. **Action Space**: Replace an atom or functional group with a less polar or bulkier group.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED value by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we can introduce less drug-like features such as larger hydrophobic groups, remove polar or hydrogen-bonding groups, or introduce steric hindrance. These changes should be made in a way that preserves the core structure of the molecule.

3. **Previous Experience:** From previous modifications, replacing polar groups with hydrophobic groups or adding bulky substituents has been effective in decreasing QED.

4. **Considerations:**
   - Maintain the core structure (e.g., the piperidine ring and the aromatic rings).
   - Avoid introducing highly polar or hydrogen-bonding groups.
   - Introduce bulky or hydrophobic groups to decrease QED.

5. **Action Plan:** Replace the amine group (NH2+) with a larger, hydrophobic group like a phenyl ring to decrease polarity and increase steric hindrance.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amine group with a phenyl ring to decrease polarity and increase steric hindrance."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule (`CCS(=O)(=O)N[C@@H](c1ccccc1)[C@@H](C)C(=O)OC`) by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce drug-likeness. The Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and polarity. To reduce QED, we can introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing hydrophobicity, removing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or increasing molecular weight in unfavorable ways.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Hydrophobicity Increase**: Adding hydrophobic groups like alkyl chains or aromatic rings can reduce QED.
2. **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors Removal**: Removing polar functional groups like amines, hydroxyls, or carbonyls can decrease QED.
3. **Molecular Weight Increase**: Adding large, non-polar substituents can reduce QED.
4. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Replace the sulfonyl group (`S(=O)(=O)`) with a more hydrophobic group like a thioether (`S`)**: This reduces hydrogen bonding and polarity, decreasing drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonyl group with a thioether group to increase hydrophobicity and reduce hydrogen bonding."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce drug-like properties. QED is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, polarity, hydrogen bonding, and aromaticity. To lower QED, we can:

1. **Increase molecular weight** by adding large, non-drug-like groups.
2. **Modify polar groups** to reduce solubility or hydrogen bonding potential.
3. **Introduce steric hindrance** to disrupt planarity or reduce bioavailability.
4. **Alter aromatic systems** to reduce aromaticity, which often contributes to drug-likeness.

Based on the structure of the root molecule, I suggest replacing the **methoxy group (COc1)** with a **bulky, non-polar group** like a tert-butyl group. This will increase molecular weight, reduce polarity, and introduce steric hindrance.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group attached to the aromatic ring with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of reducing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that decrease the drug-likeness of the molecule. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, polarity, hydrogen bonding, and lipophilicity. To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or disrupting aromaticity.

Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Add a Polar Group**: Adding a polar group like a hydroxyl or carboxyl group can increase the molecule's polarity and decrease its lipophilicity, thus reducing QED.
2. **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding a bulky group or increasing the size of the molecule can decrease QED by making it less drug-like.
3. **Disrupt Aromaticity**: Modifying or breaking an aromatic ring can decrease the molecule's stability and drug-likeness.
4. **Introduce Steric Hindrance**: Adding bulky groups that introduce steric hindrance can reduce the molecule's drug-likeness.
5. **Modify Functional Groups**: Replacing a functional group with a less drug-like one (e.g., replacing an amide with an ester) can decrease QED.

Based on these considerations, the top suggestion is to **replace the amide group with an ester group**, as this modification decreases the drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the molecule `COc1ccc2nc(CNc3ncc(F)c(N4CCOCC4)n3)[nH]c2c1` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should still retain similarity to the original molecule.

2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.7205760171324056. To decrease it by at least 0.1, the new QED should be ≤ 0.6205760171324056.

3. **Strategy**: To reduce QED, we can introduce modifications that reduce drug-likeness, such as:
   - Adding bulky or non-polar groups.
   - Introducing steric hindrance.
   - Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.
   - Adding hydrophobic groups.

4. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

5. **Modification Suggestions**:
   - Replace the fluorine atom with a more hydrophobic group like a methyl group.
   - Add a bulky group to the aromatic ring to introduce steric hindrance.
   - Replace the ether oxygen in the morpholine ring with a sulfur atom to reduce polarity.
   - Add a hydrophobic alkyl chain to the morpholine ring.
   - Replace the nitrogen in the morpholine ring with a carbon atom to reduce hydrogen bonding potential.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule \( C=C(C)C[C@@H](O)c1ncccn1 \) by at least 0.1, we need to modify the molecule in a way that makes it less drug-like while maintaining structural similarity. QED is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrogen bonding, solubility, and polarity. Introducing or modifying functional groups that reduce these properties can help achieve the goal.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Targeted Functional Groups**: The root molecule contains a double bond, a hydroxyl group, and a pyridine ring. Modifying these functional groups can impact the QED.
2. **Decrease Drug-likeness**: Adding bulky or non-polar groups, replacing polar groups with non-polar ones, or introducing steric hindrance can reduce the QED.
3. **Similarity Preservation**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

### Suggested Modifications:
1. Replace the hydroxyl group with a methoxy group to reduce hydrogen bonding potential.
2. Add a methyl group to the double bond to increase steric hindrance and reduce solubility.
3. Replace the pyridine ring with a benzene ring to reduce hydrogen bonding and polarity.
4. Introduce a chlorine atom on the pyridine ring to increase hydrophobicity.
5. Replace the hydroxyl group with a fluorine atom to reduce hydrogen bonding.

Based on the above reasoning, the top suggestion is:
- **Replace the hydroxyl group with a methoxy group.**

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the root molecule, we need to consider modifications that disrupt favorable drug-like properties. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. 

Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Disrupting hydrogen bonding**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease the QED. For example, replacing a polar group like a hydroxyl group with a non-polar group like a methoxy group could achieve this.
2. **Increasing hydrophobicity**: Adding hydrophobic groups or removing hydrophilic groups can decrease the QED. For example, replacing an amide group with an ether group can increase hydrophobicity.
3. **Breaking favorable drug-like scaffolds**: Modifying the core structure to break up aromatic systems or introduce unfavorable steric interactions can also reduce the QED.
4. **Maintaining similarity**: The modifications should be subtle to ensure the molecule remains similar to the root molecule.

Based on these considerations, the top suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the secondary carbon with a methoxy group."]
```

This modification increases hydrophobicity and reduces hydrogen bonding potential, which is likely to decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** Modify the given molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we can introduce less drug-like features such as bulky groups, polar groups, or less common functional groups. However, to maintain similarity, the modifications should be subtle and not drastically alter the core structure.
3. **Action Space:** Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group. Given the goal, adding or replacing functional groups is more likely to achieve the desired decrease in QED without significantly altering the core structure.
4. **Suggestion:** Replace the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) with a less drug-like group, such as a bulky polar group like a sulfonate or a carboxylate group. This change will introduce a more polar and less lipophilic feature, which is likely to decrease the QED significantly.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the trifluoromethyl group with a sulfonate group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the structure in a way that reduces drug-likeness while maintaining similarity to the original molecule. The QED metric is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and the presence of certain functional groups. To decrease QED, we can introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing hydrophobicity, reducing hydrogen bonding potential, or altering the steric properties.

Given the structure of the root molecule, which contains multiple hydroxyl groups and a furan ring, one effective strategy would be to replace one or more of the hydroxyl groups with less polar or more hydrophobic groups. This will reduce the hydrogen bonding potential and increase hydrophobicity, thereby decreasing the QED.

**Reasoning Process:**
1. The molecule has several hydroxyl groups, which contribute to its high QED due to their hydrogen bonding potential.
2. Replacing a hydroxyl group with a less polar group (e.g., a methyl group) will reduce the hydrogen bonding potential and increase hydrophobicity, decreasing the QED.
3. The modification should be made in a way that maintains structural similarity to the original molecule.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the furan ring with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the root molecule, we need to consider modifications that disrupt key drug-like features (e.g., hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, logP, molecular weight, and polar surface area) without drastically altering the core structure. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Disrupt Hydrogen Bonding**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED. For example, replacing an amine group with a non-polar group could achieve this.

2. **Increase LogP**: Adding hydrophobic groups or replacing polar groups with non-polar groups can increase logP, which often decreases QED.

3. **Alter Ring Systems**: Modifying ring systems (e.g., adding or removing atoms) can impact drug-likeness without drastically changing the overall structure.

4. **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Adding bulky substituents can reduce QED by increasing molecular weight or steric hindrance.

5. **Reduce Polar Surface Area**: Replacing polar functional groups with less polar ones can decrease QED.

Based on this reasoning, here is a suggestion that aligns with the goal:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) attached to the pyrrolidine ring with a methylene group (CH2)."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by more than 0.1, we need to consider modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule while maintaining its structural similarity. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To decrease QED, we can introduce less drug-like features, such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding bulky groups, or reducing polarity.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Increase Hydrophobicity**: Adding hydrophobic groups, such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings, can decrease QED.
2. **Add Bulky Groups**: Large, sterically hindered groups can reduce drug-likeness.
3. **Reduce Polarity**: Removing polar groups or replacing them with less polar ones can decrease QED.
4. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.

Given the structure of the root molecule, which contains an amide group, a carboxylate group, and a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, we can focus on modifying these functional groups or adding non-polar substituents.

### Suggested Modification:
- Replace the carboxylate group with a less polar and bulkier group, such as an ester or an alkyl chain. This will reduce the polarity and increase the hydrophobicity, thereby decreasing the QED.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, we need to introduce modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties of the molecule while maintaining its structural similarity. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can:

1. **Increase molecular weight** by adding larger substituents.
2. **Increase lipophilicity** by adding hydrophobic groups.
3. **Disrupt hydrogen bonding** by removing or modifying hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.
4. **Increase polar surface area** by adding polar groups.

Given the structure of the root molecule, we can target specific functional groups or atoms for modification. Since we want to maintain similarity, the modifications should be minimal but impactful.

### Suggested Modification

Based on the structure of the root molecule, a suitable modification would be to **replace the amide group (CNC(=O)) with a more hydrophobic and less drug-like functional group, such as a thioether group (C-S-C)**. This change will disrupt the hydrogen bonding capability of the amide, increase lipophilicity, and slightly alter the molecular weight, all of which should contribute to a decrease in QED.

### Final Suggestion

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (CNC(=O)) with a thioether group (C-S-C) in the molecule."]
``` 

This modification is expected to decrease the QED by at least 0.1 while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **QED Reduction**: The QED score is influenced by properties like molecular weight, lipophilicity, hydrogen bonding, and polar surface area. To reduce QED, we should introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or introducing non-drug-like functional groups.

2. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity. Therefore, we should focus on modifying peripheral groups or adding/removing small functional groups.

3. **Previous Experience**: Based on the experience from previous suggestions, adding bulky or polar groups tends to decrease QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

4. **Examples of Modifications**:
   - Adding a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring.
   - Replacing the nitro group with a more polar or bulky group.
   - Adding a carboxyl group to the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce less drug-like features. One effective approach is to reduce the bioavailability or increase the molecular complexity in a way that deviates from typical drug-like properties. A common strategy is to introduce bulky or polar groups that reduce the molecule's ability to cross biological membranes, thereby lowering its QED.

Given the structure of the root molecule, which contains a methoxy group, a nitro group, and a fluorine atom, we can focus on modifying these functional groups to achieve the desired QED decrease. One suggestion is to replace the methoxy group with a larger, more polar group, such as a sulfonate ester, which would increase the molecule's polarity and reduce its QED.

Here is the final suggestion in a Python list:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group with a sulfonate ester group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we can consider the following strategy:

1. **Analyze the molecule**: The molecule has several functional groups, including a ketone, an ester, an amide, and an aromatic ring. These groups contribute to its drug-like properties.
2. **Identify key modifications**: To reduce QED, we can modify or remove functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness. For instance, removing or altering the ester or amide group could reduce QED.
3. **Maintain similarity**: The modifications should not drastically change the core structure or the overall shape of the molecule to ensure it remains similar to the original.

Based on these considerations, here is a suggested modification:

**Replace the ester group with a less polar and less drug-like functional group, such as an ether group.**

This modification reduces the polarity and drug-likeness of the molecule, which should decrease the QED by the desired amount while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ester group with an ether group."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Understanding the Goal:**  
   The task is to modify the root molecule (`C[C@H]1CN(Cc2nc(CCc3ccccc3)no2)[C@H](C)CO1`) to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while keeping the modified molecules structurally similar to the original.

2. **Key Strategies to Decrease QED:**  
   - **Increase Molecular Weight:** Adding larger groups or atoms can decrease QED.
   - **Reduce Hydrogen Bond Acceptors or Donors:** Removing or replacing functional groups like amines, hydroxyls, or ethers can decrease QED.
   - **Introducing Less Favorable Substituents:** Adding groups like halogens or bulky substituents can decrease QED.
   - **Disrupting Aromaticity:** Modifying aromatic rings can decrease QED.

3. **Structural Similarity:**  
   The modifications should not drastically change the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

4. **Action Space:**  
   Based on the action space (add, delete, replace), the focus will be on replacing or adding less drug-like features without altering the core structure significantly.

5. **Suggested Modification:**  
   Replace the hydroxyl group (`OH`) on the oxygen atom in the cyclic structure with a more bulky and less polar group like a methyl group (`CH3`). This modification will decrease the QED by reducing hydrogen bonding potential and increasing molecular weight.

6. **Final Suggestion:**  
   Replace the hydroxyl group attached to the oxygen atom in the cyclic structure with a methyl group to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group attached to the oxygen atom in the cyclic structure with a methyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that reduce drug-like properties. This can be done by introducing less favorable functional groups or altering the structure in a way that reduces its compatibility with typical drug-like characteristics. Here’s the reasoning process:

### Reasoning Process:
1. **QED Reduction**: To reduce the QED significantly, we need to modify parts of the molecule that contribute to its drug-likeness. This could involve adding bulky groups, introducing polar groups, or disrupting the molecular planarity.
2. **Similarity**: The modifications should be subtle enough to maintain structural similarity to the original molecule. This means avoiding drastic changes like removing large substructures.
3. **Functional Group Impact**: Adding groups like sulfonates, nitro groups, or heavy atoms (e.g., bromine) can decrease drug-likeness.
4. **Steric Hindrance**: Introducing sterically bulky groups can reduce QED by making the molecule less likely to interact favorably with biological targets.

### Suggested Modification:
Based on the reasoning, the top suggestion is to **add a nitro group to the aromatic ring** (c2) in the molecule. This modification increases the polar surface area and introduces an electron-withdrawing group, which can reduce drug-likeness and decrease QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the aromatic ring (c2) in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. From the structure of the `root_molecule`, we can observe that it contains several drug-like features such as amide bonds, ether linkages, and aromatic rings with methoxy groups. Introducing bulkier or less polar groups, or disrupting the planar nature of the molecule, could reduce its QED.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Target Functional Groups**: The molecule contains an ester (`CCOC(=O)`), amide (`C(=O)N`), and aromatic rings with methoxy groups (`OC`). Modifying these functional groups can impact QED.
2. **Decrease Polarity**: Reducing the number of polar groups (e.g., amides or esters) or introducing non-polar groups can lower QED.
3. **Increase Steric Hindrance**: Adding bulky groups can disrupt molecular planarity and decrease drug-likeness.
4. **Aromaticity Disruption**: Modifying aromatic rings (e.g., adding substituents or breaking conjugation) can reduce QED.
5. **Similarity**: Ensure modifications do not drastically alter the core structure to maintain similarity.

### Suggested Modification:
Replace the ester group (`CCOC(=O)`) with a less polar and bulkier group, such as a tertiary butyl group, to decrease drug-likeness and lower QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ester group (CCOC(=O)) with a tertiary butyl group to decrease polarity and increase steric hindrance."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modifications should retain structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **QED Analysis**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. Decreasing QED can be achieved by introducing features that are less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, altering logP, or introducing bulky groups.

3. **Structural Similarity**: To maintain similarity, modifications should focus on regions of the molecule that are less critical to its overall structure. For example, replacing a hydrogen with a larger group or altering a side chain while keeping the core structure intact.

4. **Action Space**: Considering the action space, replacing a small functional group with a larger, less drug-like group would be effective. The aromatic rings and the chiral center should be preserved to maintain similarity.

5. **Suggested Modifications**: Replacing the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring with a bulkier, less polar group like a methoxy group or a larger alkyl chain could decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to consider modifications that disrupt drug-like properties. Drug-like molecules often have specific features like hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, aromatic rings, and specific functional groups. To reduce the QED, we can introduce bulky or non-polar groups, remove hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or introduce non-drug-like functionalities.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Disrupt Hydrogen Bonding**: Removing or replacing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (e.g., amide, amine, or ether groups) can decrease the QED.
2. **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Adding bulky or non-polar groups can reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule.
3. **Modify Aromaticity**: Altering the aromatic system (e.g., breaking aromaticity or introducing non-aromatic rings) can decrease the QED.
4. **Replace Functional Groups**: Swapping functional groups with less drug-like ones (e.g., replacing an amide with an ester or a non-polar group) can help.
5. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure to maintain similarity to the input molecule.

### Final Suggestion:
Replace the amide group (`CON`) with a non-polar ester group (`COO`).

final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a non-polar ester group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease the QED by at least 0.1, while keeping the molecule similar to the original structure. The current QED of the root molecule is 0.7525, so the target QED should be below 0.6525.

2. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce changes that reduce the molecule's drug-likeness. This can be achieved by:
   - Adding bulky or polar groups that are typically unfavorable in drug design.
   - Removing or replacing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness.
   - Introducing rigid or less flexible structures that are less likely to bind effectively to biological targets.

3. **Considerations**:
   - The molecule contains a cyclopentane ring, an amide group, and an ammonium group. These are common in drugs, so modifying them could reduce QED.
   - Introducing larger or more polar groups in place of smaller or less polar groups can help.
   - Ensure that the changes maintain structural similarity to the original molecule.

4. **Action Plan**:
   - Replace the amide group (`NC(=O)`) with a less drug-like group, such as an ester or a sulfonamide.
   - Add a polar hydroxyl group to the cyclopentane ring to increase polarity.
   - Replace the cyclopentane ring with a bulkier or less flexible ring like cyclohexane.
   - Replace the ammonium group with a less basic group like a hydroxyl group.
   - Add a bulky group like a tert-butyl group to increase steric hindrance.

### Final Suggestion:

final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a sulfonamide group to reduce drug-likeness and decrease QED."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: Modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The molecule should retain structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To reduce QED, we can introduce modifications that increase hydrophobicity, molecular weight, or complexity in a way that deviates from typical drug-like properties.
3. **Structural Similarity**: The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the original. Thus, changes should be localized and not drastically alter the core structure.
4. **Action Space**: We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. Based on the structure of the root molecule, replacing or adding specific groups could effectively reduce QED while maintaining similarity.
5. **Previous Experience**: Learning from previous modifications, we avoid repeating previous suggestions and focus on unique but effective changes.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Replace the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring with a nitro group**: Nitro groups are less drug-like compared to hydroxyl groups and can significantly reduce QED due to their impact on molecular properties like hydrophobicity and polarity. This change is localized and maintains structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-like properties. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED is influenced by molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, polar surface area, and rotatable bonds. To decrease QED, we can:
   - Increase molecular weight or logP.
   - Introduce features that increase polar surface area or add hydrogen bond donors/acceptors in a way that disrupts drug-like properties.
   - Add bulky groups or introduce rotatable bonds.

2. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule, focusing on the side chains or functional groups to maintain similarity.

3. **Action Space**: Replace or add atoms/functional groups that disrupt drug-likeness without drastically altering the core structure.

Based on this reasoning, the top-1 suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group with a carboxylic acid group."]
```

This modification will increase the polar surface area and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor count, reducing QED while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-like properties. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, solubility, and the presence of specific functional groups. To decrease QED, we can consider:

1. **Introducing bulkier or less polar groups**: This can reduce solubility and increase molecular weight.
2. **Removing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups**: This can decrease solubility and polarity.
3. **Adding hydrophobic groups**: This can make the molecule less drug-like.

Given the root molecule, it contains a polar amide group, an ether group, and a chiral center. To reduce QED while maintaining similarity, we can:

- **Replace the amide group with a less polar group**: This will decrease hydrogen bonding and polarity, thus reducing QED.
- **Replace the ether oxygen with a less polar or bulkier group**: This can reduce polarity and increase hydrophobicity.

Based on this reasoning, here is the top suggestion:

AI Suggestion 0: To address the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to consider modifications that disrupt favorable drug-like properties. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Disrupting Hydrogen Bonding**: Decreasing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can reduce QED. In this molecule, the carbonyl groups and amide nitrogens are key hydrogen bond acceptors, and the amide NH is a donor.
2. **Increasing Lipophilicity**: Adding hydrophobic groups like alkyl chains or replacing polar groups with non-polar ones can decrease QED.
3. **Disrupting Rigidity**: Introducing more flexibility (e.g., replacing a ring with a chain) can reduce QED.
4. **Breaking Symmetry**: Symmetrical molecules often have higher QED, so introducing asymmetry could help.

Given the input molecule `Cc1ccc(CCNC(=O)NCCC(=O)N2CCCCCC2)cn1`, we focus on modifications that maintain similarity while achieving the QED reduction.

**Modification Strategy**:
- Replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a less polar group to disrupt hydrogen bonding.
- Replace one of the amide nitrogens with a carbon atom to reduce hydrogen bond donor/acceptor count.
- Add a bulky hydrophobic group to increase lipophilicity.

Based on these considerations, the top-1 suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a methylene group to disrupt hydrogen bonding and increase lipophilicity."]
```

Give me five new molecules different from root_molecule in SMILES only and list them using bullet points. No explanation is needed. '}]

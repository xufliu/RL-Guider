- C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCC(C)O3)no2)[NH2+]C1

These modifications include:
- Introducing a benzene ring (in the second molecule) to increase hydrophobicity.
- Adding alkyl groups (in the third molecule) to reduce polarity.
- Replacing an oxygen with a chlorine atom (in the fourth molecule) to enhance lipophilicity.
- Modifying the ether linkage to include additional methyl groups (in the first and fifth molecules).

Each of these changes aims to reduce the molecule's overall polarity and increase its lipophilic character, thereby reducing water solubility and increasing logP.

AI answer 0: To decrease the water solubility and increase the logP of the molecule, we can introduce more hydrophobic groups or increase the branching of existing alkyl chains. Additionally, adding halogens like bromine or fluorine can also help in increasing the logP value. Here are five modified molecules based on your starting structure:

- CCN(C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1)c1ccc(C#N)c(Br)c1
- CCN(C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1)c1ccc(C#N)c(C)c1

AI answer 0: To decrease the solubility in water and increase the logP value by at least 0.5, we can introduce more lipophilic groups or remove hydrophilic functionalities. Given that the molecule already contains a negatively charged oxygen (which increases water solubility), replacing this group with a neutral, more lipophilic one could be effective. Additionally, adding alkyl chains or aromatic rings can enhance lipophilicity. Here are five modified molecules based on your starting structure:

AI answer 0: To increase the logP and decrease the solubility of the molecule, we can introduce more hydrophobic groups or remove polar functionalities. Since the current molecule already has a carboxylate group which is highly polar, one approach could be to either esterify this group or add additional hydrophobic moieties elsewhere in the structure. Here are five proposed molecules:

- CC[C@](C)(NC(=O)CNC(=O)c1cccc(Cl)c1)C(=O)OC(C)C: This molecule replaces the carboxylate with an ethyl ester, reducing polarity.
- CC[C@](C)(NC(=O)CNC(=O)c1cccc(F)c1)C(=O)[O-]: Here, the chlorine on the benzene ring is replaced with fluorine, which is less polarizing but increases lipophilicity.
- CC[C@](C)(NC(=O)CNC(=O)c1ccc(C)cc1)C(=O)[O-]: An additional methyl group is added to the benzene ring, increasing hydrophobicity.
- CC[C@](C)(NC(=O)CNC(=O)c1ccc(C#N)c1)C(=O)[O-]: A nitrile group is introduced on the benzene ring, which is hydrophobic and can increase logP.
- CC[C@](C)(NC(=O)CNC(=O)c1ccc(CC)c1)C(=O)[O-]: An ethyl group is added to the benzene ring, enhancing hydrophobic interactions.

AI answer 0: To modify the given molecule to decrease its water solubility and increase its logP value by at least 0.5, we can introduce more hydrophobic groups or increase the branching of existing alkyl chains, which will reduce the molecule's overall polarity. Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format:

- CC(C)(CC(=O)N1CCc2ccccc2C1)CC1=Nc2ccccc2S(=O)(=O)NC(C)C: Added an isopropyl group (-C(C)C) on the nitrogen.
- CC(C)(CC(=O)N1CCc2ccccc2C1)CC1=Nc2ccccc2S(=O)(=O)NC(CCC)C: Extended one of the methyl groups to a tert-butyl group (-C(CCC)C).
- CC(C)(CC(=O)N1CCc2ccccc2C1)CC1=Nc2ccccc2S(=O)(=O)NC(C(C)C)C: Added a tert-butyl group (-C(C(C)C)C) on the nitrogen.

'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Can you make root_molecule = C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1 more soluble in water and more hydrogen bond acceptors and decrease logP by at least 0. increase HBA by at least 0. ? The output molecules should be similar to the input molecule. The molecule closest to the goal so far is current_best_mol = C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1. Start the modification from C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1.  Give me five new molecules different from root_molecule in SMILES only and list them using bullet points.  '}]

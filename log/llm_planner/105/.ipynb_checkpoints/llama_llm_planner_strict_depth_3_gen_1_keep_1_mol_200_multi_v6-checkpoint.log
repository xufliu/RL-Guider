AI answer 0: I can provide you with suggestions for modifying the input molecule. However, please note that I'm an AI and cannot provide a specific, guaranteed solution. The modifications I suggest may require further optimization and testing to achieve the desired properties.

To increase permeability and decrease tPSA by at least 10, I'll consider the following strategies:

1.  Hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) and donors (HBDs) reduction
2.  Polar surface area (PSA) reduction
3.  Lipophilicity increase
4.  Molecular weight reduction

Here are five modified molecules in SMILES notation:

•   C1CC[C@H](CCc2nc([C@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1
•   CN1CC[C@H](CCc2nc([C@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1
•   C1CC[C@H](CCc2nc([C@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH+]C1
•   C1CC[C@H](CCc2nc([C@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2]C1
•   C1CC[C@H](CCc2nc([C@H]3CSCCO3)no2)C1

These modifications involve:

*   Replacing the amino group with a nitrile group (CN) to reduce HBDs
*   Replacing the amino group with a primary amine (NH+) to reduce HBAs
*   Removing the amino group to reduce HBAs and HBDs
*   Replacing the amino group with a secondary amine (NH2) to reduce HBAs

Please note that these modifications may require further optimization and testing to achieve the desired properties.

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous information and the goal to increase permeability and decrease tPSA by at least 10, I'll consider the following strategies:

1.  Hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) and donors (HBDs) reduction
2.  Polar surface area (PSA) reduction
3.  Lipophilicity increase
4.  Molecular weight reduction

From the previous suggestions, we learned that replacing the amino group with a nitrile group (CN) to reduce HBDs and removing the amino group to reduce HBAs and HBDs are effective strategies.

However, to further reduce tPSA and increase permeability, I suggest the following actions:

*   Replace the nitro group (no2) with a methyl group (CH3) to reduce polar surface area and increase lipophilicity.
*   Add a methyl group to the sulfur atom to increase lipophilicity and reduce molecular weight.
*   Replace the thioether group (CSCCO3) with an ether group (CCO) to reduce polar surface area and increase lipophilicity.

Considering the previous suggestions and the goal to achieve the desired properties, my top suggestion is:

*   Replace the nitro group (no2) with a methyl group (CH3).

This modification reduces the number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, decreases the polar surface area, and increases lipophilicity, which should help to increase permeability and decrease tPSA.

Here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the nitro group (no2) with a methyl group (CH3)"
]
```

This suggestion is based on the previous experience and considers the similarity before and after modification. It also meets the guidelines of not repeating previous suggestions and not showing abbreviations for atoms or functional groups.

AI answer 0: I can provide you with five modified molecules that have higher permeability and decreased tPSA by at least 10. However, please note that these modifications are based on general principles of drug design and may require further optimization and experimental validation.

To modify the input molecule, I considered the following strategies:

1.  Reduce the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (OH, NH, and N) to decrease tPSA.
2.  Increase lipophilicity to enhance permeability.
3.  Minimize steric hindrance to facilitate binding and absorption.

Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format:

*   C1=CC=C(C(=C1)F)C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2)NC(=O)C(=O)NCCc3ccccc3C
*   C1=CC=C(C(=C1)F)C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2)NC(=O)C(=O)NCCc3ccncc3C
*   C1=CC=C(C(=C1)F)C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2)NC(=O)C(=O)NCCc3ccc(cc3)C
*   C1=CC=C(C(=C1)F)C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2)NC(=O)C(=O)NCCc3ccc(cc3)C(F)C
*   C1=CC=C(C(=C1)F)C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2)NC(=O)C(=O)NCCc3ccc(cc3)C(F)C(F)

These molecules aim to reduce the number of hydrogen bond acceptors, increase lipophilicity, and minimize steric hindrance. However, the optimal modifications may depend on the specific biological target and the desired pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To address the goal of increasing permeability and decreasing tPSA by at least 10, while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, I will consider the previous suggestions and the given guidelines.

From the previous messages, I noticed that the previous suggestions involved replacing the fluorine atom with a hydrogen atom to decrease tPSA and increase lipophilicity. However, this modification did not achieve the desired decrease in tPSA.

To learn from the previous experience, I will consider the following strategies:

1.  Replace the fluorine atom with a methyl group to increase lipophilicity and potentially decrease tPSA.
2.  Delete the hydroxyl group attached to the carbon atom to decrease tPSA.
3.  Replace the amide group with an ester group to decrease tPSA.

Considering the similarity before and after modification, I will suggest the following modifications:

1.  Replace the fluorine atom with a methyl group.
2.  Delete the hydroxyl group attached to the carbon atom.
3.  Replace the amide group with an ester group.

Based on these considerations, I will provide a python list named final_suggestion with the top-1 suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the fluorine atom with a methyl group to increase lipophilicity and potentially decrease tPSA.",
    "Delete the hydroxyl group attached to the carbon atom to decrease tPSA.",
    "Replace the amide group with an ester group to decrease tPSA."
]
```

However, considering the previous suggestions and the given guidelines, I will choose the first suggestion as the top-1 suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluorine atom with a methyl group to increase lipophilicity and potentially decrease tPSA."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous information, the goal is to modify the molecule C#CCOc1cc(C)ccc1NC(=O)C(=O)NCCc1ccncc1C to increase its permeability and decrease its tPSA by at least 10. The current best molecule has a tPSA of 80.32, which is still above the threshold.

Considering the previous modifications, we have replaced the fluorine atom with a methyl group, which increased lipophilicity but did not significantly decrease tPSA. To further modify the molecule, we need to explore other options that reduce tPSA while maintaining or increasing lipophilicity.

From the previous messages, we can see that the molecule has a nitrogated ring (c1ccncc1) that may be contributing to the high tPSA. One possible action is to modify this ring to reduce its tPSA contribution.

Another possible action is to add a methyl group to a carbon atom that is not part of the nitrogated ring, which may increase lipophilicity and reduce tPSA.

Based on these considerations, the final suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the nitrogated ring (c1ccncc1) with a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) to reduce tPSA.",
    "Add a methyl group to a carbon atom that is not part of the nitrogated ring, such as C(=O)NCC, to increase lipophilicity and reduce tPSA."
]
```

These suggestions aim to reduce tPSA while maintaining or increasing lipophilicity, and are based on the previous modifications and the current best molecule.

AI answer 0: I can provide you with five modified molecules that have higher permeability and lower tPSA (at least 10 units less than the original molecule). However, please note that these modifications are based on general principles of drug design and may not be optimal for a specific target or biological system.

To increase permeability, I've focused on:

1. Reducing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (O, N, and F) to decrease polar surface area.
2. Increasing lipophilicity (logP) to facilitate membrane penetration.
3. Minimizing charged functional groups.

To decrease tPSA, I've focused on:

1. Removing or replacing hydrogen bond acceptors.
2. Decreasing the number of nitrogen atoms.

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous information and the guidelines, I will analyze the situation and provide a suggestion.

The goal is to make the molecule CCC[NH2+]Cc1ncoc1-c1c(F)cccc1F higher permeability and decrease tPSA by at least 10 units. The previous suggestions have been provided, and we need to learn from the previous experience and avoid repeating the same suggestions.

From the previous messages, we can see that the previous suggestions have focused on reducing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors, increasing lipophilicity, and minimizing charged functional groups. However, the tPSA of the previous candidate CCC[NH2+]Cc1ncoc1-c1ccccc1F is still 42.64, which is not decreased by at least 10 units.

Considering the current best molecule CCC[NH2+]Cc1ncoc1-c1ccccc1F, we can see that it has a fluorine atom attached to the benzene ring. To decrease tPSA, we can consider replacing this fluorine atom with a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, which would reduce the number of hydrogen bond acceptors and decrease the polar surface area.

Another possibility is to replace the ammonium group (NH2+) with a neutral nitrogen atom (N), which would minimize the charged functional group and decrease the tPSA.

Based on these considerations, my suggestion is:

* Replace the fluorine atom attached to the benzene ring with a methyl group.
* Replace the ammonium group (NH2+) with a neutral nitrogen atom (N).

These modifications would decrease the tPSA and increase the lipophilicity of the molecule, making it more permeable.

Here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the fluorine atom attached to the benzene ring with a methyl group.",
    "Replace the ammonium group (NH2+) with a neutral nitrogen atom (N)."
]
```

This suggestion is based on the analysis of the previous information and the guidelines provided. It aims to decrease the tPSA and increase the lipophilicity of the molecule, making it more permeable.

AI answer 0: I can provide you with five alternative molecules that may have higher permeability and lower tPSA (topological polar surface area) compared to the input molecule. However, please note that predicting the exact properties of molecules can be complex and may require more information about the specific requirements and constraints.

Here are five alternative molecules in SMILES notation:

• CCc1ccc(NC(=O)CN2C(=O)C[C@H](c3ccccc3)Sc3ccccc32)cc1
• CCc1ccc(NC(=O)CN2C(=O)CC[C@@H](c3ccccc3)Sc3ccccc32)cc1
• CCc1ccc(NC(=O)CN2C(=O)C[C@H](c3ccccc3)Nc3ccccc32)cc1
• CCc1ccc(NC(=O)CN2C(=O)C[C@H](c3ccccc3)C(c4ccccc4)Sc3ccccc32)cc1
• CCc1ccc(NC(=O)CN2C(=O)C[C@H](c3ccccc3)S(=O)(=O)c4ccccc42)cc1

These molecules are generated by modifying the input molecule through various chemical transformations, such as:

* Replacing the sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom
* Changing the orientation of the aromatic rings
* Adding or removing functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amine, or carbonyl groups)
* Modifying the stereochemistry of the molecule

Please note that these molecules may not be optimized for specific properties or requirements, and further optimization may be necessary to achieve the desired characteristics. Additionally, the tPSA values of these molecules may not be exactly lower by at least 10, as the tPSA calculation can be sensitive to the specific implementation and parameters used.

It's also worth noting that predicting the exact properties of molecules can be complex and may require more information about the specific requirements and constraints, as well as the use of advanced computational tools and techniques. If you have more information about the specific requirements and constraints, I can provide more tailored suggestions.

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous information and the goal of increasing the permeability and decreasing the tPSA by at least 10, I will analyze the situation step by step.

Firstly, the previous suggestions did not meet the tPSA decrease requirement, so we need to consider new modifications. 

Looking at the previous molecules, we can see that they were generated by modifying the input molecule through various chemical transformations, such as replacing the sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom, changing the orientation of the aromatic rings, adding or removing functional groups, and modifying the stereochemistry of the molecule.

Considering the similarity before and after modification, I will suggest the following modifications:

1. Replace the sulfur atom with an oxygen atom in the cyclohexane ring.
2. Add a methyl group to the aromatic ring to increase lipophilicity and permeability.
3. Replace the carbonyl group with a hydroxyl group to decrease tPSA.
4. Change the orientation of the aromatic rings to increase lipophilicity and permeability.
5. Add a hydrogen bond acceptor group, such as an amine group, to the aromatic ring to increase solubility and permeability.

Based on these modifications, here are the top-1 suggestions:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the sulfur atom with an oxygen atom in the cyclohexane ring to decrease tPSA and increase permeability.",
    "Add a methyl group to the aromatic ring to increase lipophilicity and permeability.",
    "Replace the carbonyl group with a hydroxyl group to decrease tPSA.",
    "Change the orientation of the aromatic rings to increase lipophilicity and permeability.",
    "Add a hydrogen bond acceptor group, such as an amine group, to the aromatic ring to increase solubility and permeability."
]
```

These suggestions are designed to address the tPSA decrease requirement and increase permeability while maintaining similarity to the original molecule.

These molecules are generated by replacing the sulfur atom with an oxygen atom in the cyclohexane ring, while maintaining the overall structure and connectivity of the molecule. This modification may help to decrease tPSA and increase permeability, as oxygen is a smaller atom than sulfur and may allow for more efficient passage through cell membranes.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the intent of the $root_question, we need to consider the previous information and the current state of the search.

From the previous messages, we can see that the current best molecule is CCc1ccc(NC(=O)CN2C(=O)C[C@H](c3ccccc3)Oc3ccccc32)cc1, and its tPSA is 58.64, which is still higher than the target value. We also know that the previous modification involved replacing the sulfur atom with an oxygen atom in the cyclohexane ring.

Given the current state of the search and the goal of decreasing tPSA by at least 10, I would suggest the following possible actions:

1. Replace the carbonyl group (C(=O)) with a hydroxyl group (OH) to decrease the polarity of the molecule and reduce tPSA.
2. Add a methyl group (CH3) to the cyclohexane ring to increase the non-polar character of the molecule and improve permeability.
3. Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with an ether group (COC) to reduce the polarity of the molecule and decrease tPSA.
4. Delete the cyclohexane ring and replace it with a smaller ring, such as a cyclopentane ring, to reduce the size of the molecule and improve permeability.
5. Replace the aromatic ring with a non-aromatic ring, such as a cyclohexene ring, to reduce the polarity of the molecule and decrease tPSA.

These suggestions are based on the previous experience and the current state of the search. They aim to decrease tPSA by at least 10 and improve permeability while maintaining the overall structure and connectivity of the molecule.

Here is the final suggestion in a Python list:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the carbonyl group with a hydroxyl group to decrease the polarity of the molecule and reduce tPSA.",
    "Add a methyl group to the cyclohexane ring to increase the non-polar character of the molecule and improve permeability.",
    "Replace the amide group with an ether group to reduce the polarity of the molecule and decrease tPSA.",
    "Delete the cyclohexane ring and replace it with a smaller ring, such as a cyclopentane ring, to reduce the size of the molecule and improve permeability.",
    "Replace the aromatic ring with a non-aromatic ring, such as a cyclohexene ring, to reduce the polarity of the molecule and decrease tPSA."
]
```

Note that these suggestions are based on the previous information and the current state of the search, and they aim to achieve the goal of decreasing tPSA by at least 10 and improving permeability.

AI answer 0: I can provide you with five modified molecules that aim to increase permeability and decrease tPSA by at least 10 units. Please note that these modifications are based on general principles of drug design and may not be optimal for a specific molecule.

Here are five modified molecules in SMILES notation:

• CC(C(C1)CC[C@H]1CCc2c(sc(NC(=O)c3cccs3)c2C(N)=O)C1)F 
• CC(C(C1)CC[C@H]1CCc2c(sc(NC(=O)c3ccscc3)c2C(N)=O)C1)Cl

• CC(C(C1)CC[C@H]1CCc2c(sc(NC(=O)c3ccc(cc3)c2C(N)=O)C1)S

These modifications aim to increase permeability by:

- Introducing a fluorine atom (F) to improve lipophilicity and reduce polar surface area.
- Introducing a chlorine atom (Cl) to improve lipophilicity and reduce polar surface area.
- Introducing a nitrogen atom (N) to improve lipophilicity and reduce polar surface area.
- Introducing an oxygen atom (O) to reduce polar surface area.
- Introducing a sulfur atom (S) to reduce polar surface area.

These modifications aim to decrease tPSA by:

- Replacing a hydroxyl group (-OH) with a fluorine atom (F), which reduces polar surface area.
- Replacing a hydroxyl group (-OH) with a chlorine atom (Cl), which reduces polar surface area.
- Replacing a hydroxyl group (-OH) with a nitrogen atom (N), which reduces polar surface area.
- Replacing a hydroxyl group (-OH) with an oxygen atom (O), which reduces polar surface area.
- Replacing a hydroxyl group (-OH) with a sulfur atom (S), which reduces polar surface area.

Please note that these modifications are based on general principles of drug design and may not be optimal for a specific molecule. Further optimization and evaluation are necessary to determine the most suitable modifications.

AI answer 0: I can provide you with five molecules that have a similar structure to the input molecule and have a lower tPSA and potentially higher permeability. However, please note that these modifications are based on general principles of drug design and may not be optimal for a specific biological system.

To decrease tPSA, we can consider the following strategies:

1.  Reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors (NH, OH, etc.)
2.  Reduce the number of polar functional groups
3.  Increase lipophilicity

To increase permeability, we can consider the following strategies:

1.  Increase lipophilicity
2.  Reduce molecular weight
3.  Improve molecular flexibility

Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format:

*   CC(=O)C(C)(C)[C@H]1CCC[NH+](Cc2nc3cc(Cl)ccc3n2C)C1
*   CC(=O)C(C)(C)[C@H]1CCC[NH+](Cc2nc3ccc(Cl)cc3n2C)C1
*   CC(=O)C(C)(C)[C@H]1CCC[NH+](Cc2nc3ccc(C)cc3n2C)C1

*   CC(=O)C(C)(C)[C@H]1CCC[NH+](Cc2nc3ccc(OC)cc3n2C)C1

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the intent of the $root_question, we need to consider the following:

1. The current best molecule has a tPSA of 39.33, which is lower than the previous one (48.56). However, we need to decrease the tPSA by at least 10 more.
2. The previous molecule had a tPSA of 48.56, and we need to find a way to decrease it further while keeping the molecule similar.
3. The previous suggestions aimed to reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors and polar functional groups, while increasing lipophilicity to potentially improve permeability.
4. The current best molecule has a similar structure to the input molecule, but we need to find a way to modify it further to achieve the desired tPSA decrease.

Based on these considerations, here are a few possible actions that could achieve the intent of the $root_question:

*   Replace the chlorine atom in the molecule with a fluorine atom to reduce the polarity of the molecule and decrease the tPSA further.
*   Delete the hydrogen bond donor (NH+) in the molecule to reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors and decrease the tPSA.
*   Replace the aromatic ring with a non-aromatic ring (such as a cyclohexane ring) to reduce the polarity of the molecule and decrease the tPSA.

However, we need to be careful not to repeat the previous suggestions, and we need to consider the similarity before and after modification.

Based on these considerations, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the chlorine atom in the molecule with a fluorine atom to reduce the polarity of the molecule and decrease the tPSA further.",
    "Delete the hydrogen bond donor (NH+) in the molecule to reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors and decrease the tPSA.",
    "Replace the aromatic ring with a non-aromatic ring (such as a cyclohexane ring) to reduce the polarity of the molecule and decrease the tPSA.",
    "Replace the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group with a sulfur atom to reduce the polarity of the molecule and decrease the tPSA.",
    "Delete the methyl group attached to the aromatic ring to reduce the lipophilicity of the molecule and decrease the tPSA."
]
```

These suggestions aim to reduce the polarity of the molecule, decrease the number of hydrogen bond donors, and reduce the lipophilicity of the molecule to potentially improve permeability. However, the actual performance of these molecules will depend on their specific biological activity and the system being studied.

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous information, we have been trying to modify the molecule COC(=O)C(C)(C)[C@H]1CCC[NH+](Cc2nc3cc(Cl)ccc3n2C)C1 to have higher permeability and decrease tPSA by at least 10. We have already replaced the chlorine atom with a fluorine atom, but the tPSA of the resulting molecule is still 48.56, which is not a significant decrease.

To further reduce tPSA, we need to consider the following strategies:

1.  Reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors (NH, OH, etc.)
2.  Reduce the number of polar functional groups
3.  Increase lipophilicity

Given the current molecule COC(=O)C(C)(C)[C@H]1CCC[NH+](Cc2nc3cc(F)ccc3n2C)C1, we can consider the following modifications:

*   Replace the NH+ group with a CH2 group to reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors.
*   Replace the nitrogen-containing ring with a non-polar ring, such as a phenyl ring.
*   Add a methyl group to increase lipophilicity.

However, we need to be careful not to make too many changes at once, as this may affect the molecule's similarity to the original molecule.

Based on these considerations, my top-1 suggestion is:

```
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the nitrogen-containing ring with a phenyl ring to reduce polarity and tPSA."
]
```

This suggestion aims to reduce the number of polar functional groups and increase lipophilicity, while maintaining the similarity to the original molecule.

AI answer 0: To increase the permeability and decrease the tPSA of the given molecule, we can consider the following modifications:

1.  Introduction of a methyl group to reduce the tPSA and increase the lipophilicity.
2.  Replacement of the nitro group with a less polar group to reduce the tPSA.
3.  Introduction of a fluorine atom to increase the lipophilicity and reduce the tPSA.
4.  Replacement of the carbonyl group with a less polar group to reduce the tPSA.
5.  Introduction of a methyl group to reduce the tPSA and increase the lipophilicity.

Here are five modified molecules in SMILES notation:

*   Cc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1OC(=O)[C@H]1CC(=O)Nc2ccccc21

AI answer 0: I can provide you with some suggestions to increase the permeability and decrease the tPSA of the given molecule. However, please note that these modifications are based on general principles and may not be the only possible solutions.

To increase permeability, we can try to:

1. Reduce the molecular weight
2. Decrease the number of hydrogen bond acceptors
3. Increase the lipophilicity

To decrease tPSA, we can try to:

1. Reduce the number of hydrogen bond acceptors
2. Decrease the number of nitrogen atoms

Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format that meet the above criteria:

• C[C@H](NCC(C)(C)[NH+]1CCN(C)CC1)c1ccc(Cl)s1
• C[C@H](NCC(C)[NH+]1CCN(C)CC1)c1ccc(Cl)s1
• C[C@H](NCC(C)[NH+]1CCN(C)CC1)c1ccc(F)s1
• C[C@H](NCC(C)[NH+]1CCN(C)CC1)c1ccc(Br)s1
• C[C@H](NCC(C)[NH+]1CCN(C)CC1)c1ccc(H)C(=O)Nc1

These modifications involve:

* Removing a nitrogen atom in the first molecule
* Removing a carbon atom in the second molecule
* Replacing a chlorine atom with a fluorine atom in the third molecule
* Replacing a chlorine atom with a bromine atom in the fourth molecule
* Adding a carbonyl group to the fifth molecule

Please note that these modifications are just suggestions and may not be the optimal solution for your specific molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous information, the goal is to modify the given molecule to increase its permeability and decrease its tPSA by at least 10. 

To achieve this, we need to consider the suggestions provided in the previous message. The previous suggestions involved removing a nitrogen atom, removing a carbon atom, replacing a chlorine atom with a fluorine or bromine atom, and adding a carbonyl group. However, these modifications may not be the optimal solution for the given molecule.

Considering the previous experience, the substructure change of molecules, and the goal of increasing permeability and decreasing tPSA, I would suggest the following modifications:

1. Replace the chlorine atom on the benzene ring with a methyl group to increase lipophilicity and decrease the number of hydrogen bond acceptors.
2. Remove the nitrogen atom on the amine group to decrease the number of hydrogen bond acceptors and nitrogen atoms.
3. Add a methoxy group to the benzene ring to increase lipophilicity and decrease the number of hydrogen bond acceptors.
4. Replace the carbonyl group on the amine with a hydroxyl group to decrease the number of hydrogen bond acceptors and increase the number of hydrogen bond donors.
5. Remove the carbon atom on the amine group to decrease the molecular weight and the number of hydrogen bond acceptors.

These modifications are designed to increase the lipophilicity of the molecule, decrease the number of hydrogen bond acceptors, and decrease the molecular weight. They also consider the similarity before and after modification.

Here are the five modified molecules in SMILES format:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the chlorine atom on the benzene ring with a methyl group.",
    "Remove the nitrogen atom on the amine group.",
    "Add a methoxy group to the benzene ring.",
    "Replace the carbonyl group on the amine with a hydroxyl group.",
    "Remove the carbon atom on the amine group."
]
```

These modifications are based on general principles of drug design and may not be the only possible solutions. The optimal solution will depend on the specific properties and behavior of the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the permeability and decreasing the tPSA of the molecule, let's analyze the previous modifications and the current best molecule.

From the previous messages, we can see that the current best molecule is C[C@H](NCC(C)(C)[NH+]1CCN(C)CC1)c1ccc(C)s1, which has a tPSA of 19.71. The previous modifications involved replacing the chlorine atom on the benzene ring with a methyl group, but it didn't achieve the goal.

Considering the previous experience, we should focus on modifying the benzene ring to increase the permeability and decrease the tPSA. Since the previous modifications didn't work, let's try a different approach.

One possible action is to replace the methyl group on the benzene ring with a propyl group. This modification will introduce a longer alkyl chain, which may increase the lipophilicity and improve the permeability.

Another possible action is to add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring. This modification will introduce a hydrogen bond acceptor, but it may also increase the tPSA. However, if we can balance the increase in tPSA with a decrease in the number of nitrogen atoms, it may still achieve the goal.

Based on the previous experience and the current best molecule, here are two possible suggestions:

* Replace the methyl group on the benzene ring with a propyl group.
* Add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring and delete one of the nitrogen atoms.

However, since the previous message suggested not to repeat the previous suggestion, we should consider other modifications. Let's try to replace the methyl group on the benzene ring with a phenyl group. This modification will introduce a new aromatic ring, which may increase the lipophilicity and improve the permeability.

Here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the methyl group on the benzene ring with a propyl group.",
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring and delete one of the nitrogen atoms.",
    "Replace the methyl group on the benzene ring with a phenyl group."
]
```

These suggestions are based on the previous experience and the current best molecule, and they consider the similarity before and after modification.

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous information and the guidelines provided, I will analyze the situation and suggest possible actions to achieve the intent of the root question.

The root question is to make the molecule N#Cc1c(NC(=O)c2ccc(Br)nc2)sc2c1CCC2 higher permeability and decrease tPSA by at least 10. The current tPSA of the molecule is 65.78, which is above the threshold.

From the previous messages, I have learned that replacing Br with a less polar group (F) is a possible approach to decrease tPSA and increase permeability. However, this approach did not lead to a significant decrease in tPSA (still 65.78).

Considering the previous experience, I will explore alternative approaches to decrease tPSA and increase permeability. Since the previous suggestions did not lead to a significant decrease in tPSA, I will focus on modifying the molecule by replacing or removing functional groups that contribute to the high tPSA.

Based on the $action_space, I will suggest the following modifications:

* Replace the sulfur atom with a less polar group (e.g., carbon or hydrogen) to decrease tPSA.
* Remove an oxygen atom to decrease tPSA and molecular weight.
* Replace a nitrogen atom with a less polar group (e.g., carbon or hydrogen) to decrease tPSA.

However, I will not repeat the previous suggestion of replacing Br with F, as it did not lead to a significant decrease in tPSA.

Considering the similarity before and after modification, I will suggest the following modifications:

* Replace the sulfur atom with a carbon atom to maintain the molecular framework while decreasing tPSA.
* Remove the oxygen atom attached to the nitrogen atom to decrease tPSA and molecular weight while maintaining the molecular framework.
* Replace the nitrogen atom with a carbon atom to decrease tPSA and molecular weight while maintaining the molecular framework.

Based on these considerations, my final suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the sulfur atom with a carbon atom to maintain the molecular framework while decreasing tPSA.",
    "Remove the oxygen atom attached to the nitrogen atom to decrease tPSA and molecular weight while maintaining the molecular framework.",
    "Replace the nitrogen atom with a carbon atom to decrease tPSA and molecular weight while maintaining the molecular framework.",
    "Replace the sulfur atom with a hydrogen atom to decrease tPSA and molecular weight while maintaining the molecular framework.",
    "Remove the nitrogen atom attached to the sulfur atom to decrease tPSA and molecular weight while maintaining the molecular framework."
]
```

These suggestions aim to decrease tPSA and increase permeability by modifying the functional groups and molecular framework of the original molecule.

AI answer 0: I can provide you with five modified molecules that may have higher permeability and a lower tPSA. Please note that these modifications are suggestions based on general principles of drug design, and actual performance may vary depending on the specific context and requirements.

Here are five modified molecules in SMILES notation:

• C1=NC2=C(N(C(N(C3=CC=CC=C3)C(N(C4=CC=CC=C4)C2=O)C5=CC=CC=C5)C1=O)C(N(C6=CC=CC=C6)C7=CC=CC=C7)F
• C1=NC2=C(N(C(N(C3=CC=CC=C3)C(N(C4=CC=CC=C4)C2=O)C5=CC=CC=C5)C1=O)C(N(C6=CC=CC=C6)C7=CC=CC=C7)F)C8=CC=CC=C8
• C1=NC2=C(N(C(N(C3=CC=CC=C3)C(N(C4=CC=CC=C4)C2=O)C5=CC=CC=C5)C1=O)C(N(C6=CC=CC=C6)C7=CC=CC=C7)F)N(C8=CC=CC=C8)
• C1=NC2=C(N(C(N(C3=CC=CC=C3)C(N(C4=CC=CC=C4)C2=O)C5=CC=CC=C5)C1=O)C(N(C6=CC=CC=C6)C7=CC=CC=C7)F)C(C8=CC=CC=C8)C9=CC=CC=C9
• C1=NC2=C(N(C(N(C3=CC=CC=C3)C(N(C4=CC=CC=C4)C2=O)C5=CC=CC=C5)C1=O)C(N(C6=CC=CC=C6)C7=CC=CC=C7)F)C(C8=CC=CC=C8)N(C9=CC=CC=C9)

These modifications aim to:

* Reduce tPSA by removing or replacing polar functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NH2)
* Increase lipophilicity by adding or replacing alkyl or aryl groups
* Maintain or improve the molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions

Please note that these modifications are suggestions and may require further optimization and testing to achieve the desired properties.

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous messages and properties, I can see that the goal is to increase the permeability and decrease the tPSA of the input molecule by at least 10. 

The previous suggestions were to add a nitrogen atom to the cyclohexane ring, which resulted in a tPSA of 75.43. However, this is still above the desired threshold. 

Considering the previous experience and the substructure change of molecules, I will suggest alternative modifications that aim to reduce the tPSA further while maintaining the similarity to the original molecule.

Upon analyzing the input molecule, I notice that the bromine atom is attached to a benzene ring. To reduce the tPSA, I will suggest modifications that replace or delete the bromine atom or the benzene ring.

Here are five possible modifications:

* Replace the bromine atom with a hydrogen atom to reduce the tPSA.
* Delete the benzene ring to reduce the tPSA.
* Replace the benzene ring with a cyclohexane ring to reduce the tPSA.
* Add a methyl group to the nitrogen atom to reduce the tPSA.
* Add a hydroxyl group to the nitrogen atom to reduce the tPSA.

These modifications aim to reduce the tPSA while maintaining the similarity to the original molecule. However, please note that these modifications are hypothetical and should be validated through experimental and computational methods.

Based on the previous experience and the substructure change of molecules, I will choose the top-1 suggestion as follows:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the benzene ring with a cyclohexane ring to reduce the tPSA."
]
```

This suggestion aims to reduce the tPSA by replacing the benzene ring with a cyclohexane ring, which is a more lipophilic and less polar functional group. This modification is expected to increase the permeability of the molecule while reducing the tPSA.

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous messages, the current best molecule is O=C(NCCC(=O)N1CCCCC1)[C@H]1C[C@@H]1c1ccccc1c1cccc(Br)c1 with a tPSA of 49.410000000000004. The goal is to decrease the tPSA by at least 10 while increasing the permeability of the molecule.

Considering the previous suggestions, it seems that replacing the benzene ring with a cyclohexane ring did not achieve the desired result. Therefore, I will explore other options for modifying the molecule.

From the previous message, I noticed that the suggestion of replacing the benzene ring with a cyclohexane ring was not successful. This might be due to the fact that the cyclohexane ring is not a suitable replacement for the benzene ring in terms of increasing the permeability of the molecule.

Given the current state of the molecule and the goal of decreasing the tPSA by at least 10, I will suggest the following modifications:

* Replace the benzene ring with a pyridine ring to introduce a nitrogen atom, which can help to increase the permeability of the molecule.
* Add a hydroxyl group to the cyclohexane ring to increase the polarity of the molecule and potentially improve its solubility.
* Replace the cyclohexane ring with a phenol ring to introduce a hydroxyl group and potentially increase the polarity of the molecule.
* Replace the benzene ring with a naphthalene ring to introduce a larger aromatic ring, which can help to increase the permeability of the molecule.
* Add a methyl group to the cyclohexane ring to increase the lipophilicity of the molecule and potentially improve its permeability.

Here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the benzene ring with a pyridine ring.",
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the cyclohexane ring.",
    "Replace the cyclohexane ring with a phenol ring.",
    "Replace the benzene ring with a naphthalene ring.",
    "Add a methyl group to the cyclohexane ring."
]
```

These modifications aim to increase the permeability of the molecule while decreasing its tPSA by at least 10.

AI answer 0: To increase the permeability and decrease the tPSA of the input molecule, we need to consider several factors such as lipophilicity, polarity, and the presence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Here are five modified molecules that aim to achieve these goals:

* CC1=NC(=C(C(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)nn2)C(=O)NN)C(=O)Nc3cccc1C3
* CC1=NC(=C(C(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)nn2)C(=O)Nc3cccc3)C(=O)Nc4cccc1C4
* CC1=NC(=C(C(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)nn2)C(=O)NN)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3C1
* CC1=NC(=C(C(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)nn2)C(=O)NN)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3C1
* CC1=NC(=C(C(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)nn2)C(=O)NN)C(=O)Nc3ccc(Cl)C1C3

These molecules have been modified by replacing the nitrogen atom attached to the benzene ring with a carbon atom, and by introducing a chlorine atom on the benzene ring to increase lipophilicity. The number of nitrogen atoms has been reduced to decrease tPSA. The modifications aim to maintain the similarity to the input molecule while improving its pharmacokinetic properties.

AI answer 0: I can provide you with five modified molecules that may have higher permeability and lower tPSA compared to the original molecule. However, please note that these modifications are based on general principles of drug design and may not guarantee optimal properties.

To increase permeability, we can try to:
- Reduce the molecular weight
- Decrease the number of hydrogen bond acceptors
- Increase the number of hydrogen bond donors
- Decrease the number of rotatable bonds
- Increase lipophilicity

To decrease tPSA, we can try to:
- Reduce the number of nitrogen and oxygen atoms
- Decrease the number of hydrogen bond acceptors

Here are five modified molecules:

* CC(C)n1nccc1NC(=O)NC(C)C[C@H](O)CN1CCO
* CC(C)n1nccc1NC(=O)NC(C)C[C@H](O)C1CCO
* CC(C)n1nccc1NC(=O)NC(C)C[C@H]CN1CCO
* CC(C)n1nccc1NC(=O)N(C)C[C@H](O)CN1CC
* CC(C)n1nccc1NC(=O)NC(C)C[C@H](O)CN1C

Please note that these modifications are based on general principles of drug design and may not guarantee optimal properties. Further optimization and testing are required to determine the optimal properties of these molecules.

AI answer 0: I can provide you with five modified molecules that have higher permeability and decreased tPSA. However, please note that these modifications are based on general principles and may not be optimal for a specific molecule.

To increase permeability, we can consider the following strategies:

1.  Reduce molecular weight and size
2.  Decrease the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) and donors (HBD)
3.  Increase lipophilicity

To decrease tPSA, we can consider the following strategies:

1.  Reduce the number of HBA

AI answer 0: I can provide you with five modified molecules that have higher permeability and lower tPSA. Please note that these modifications are based on general principles of drug design and may not be optimal for a specific target or biological system.

To increase permeability and decrease tPSA, I'll consider the following strategies:

1. Reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors (OH, NH, SH)
2. Reduce the number of polar atoms (O, N, S)
3. Increase lipophilicity (hydrophobicity)
4. Maintain or improve interactions with the target protein

Here are five modified molecules in SMILES notation:

• CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nnc1-c1ccccc1
• CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nnc1-c1cccnc1
• CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nnc1-c1ccccc1Cl
• CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nnc1-c1cccnc1F
• CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nnc1-c1cccnc1CF3

These modifications aim to reduce the number of polar atoms and hydrogen bond donors while increasing lipophilicity. The exact effects of these modifications on permeability and tPSA will depend on the specific target and biological system.

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous messages and properties, I will consider the following:

1. The goal is to increase permeability and decrease tPSA by at least 10 units.
2. The previous molecule had a tPSA of 59.81, which is above the desired threshold.
3. The previous suggestions aimed to reduce the number of polar atoms and hydrogen bond donors while increasing lipophilicity.
4. The current best molecule is CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nnc1-c1ccccc1.

To further optimize the molecule, I will consider the following actions:

- Replace the sulfur atom in the thiophene ring with a carbon atom to reduce the number of polar atoms and increase lipophilicity.
- Delete the nitrogen atom in the thiophene ring to reduce the number of polar atoms and hydrogen bond donors.
- Replace the carbonyl group (C(=O)) with a methylene group (CH2) to reduce the number of polar atoms and hydrogen bond donors.
- Add a fluorine atom to the thiophene ring to increase lipophilicity and reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors.
- Delete the methyl group attached to the thiophene ring to reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors and increase lipophilicity.

Considering these actions and the previous suggestions, I will provide a new list of suggestions.

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the sulfur atom in the thiophene ring with a carbon atom.",
    "Delete the nitrogen atom in the thiophene ring.",
    "Replace the carbonyl group with a methylene group.",
    "Add a fluorine atom to the thiophene ring.",
    "Delete the methyl group attached to the thiophene ring."
]
```

These suggestions aim to further reduce the number of polar atoms and hydrogen bond donors while increasing lipophilicity, which should improve permeability and decrease tPSA.

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous information and the goal of increasing permeability and decreasing tPSA by at least 10, I will analyze the previous suggestions and provide a new suggestion that meets the guidelines.

From the previous messages, it can be seen that the previous suggestions were based on replacing the benzene ring with a substituted benzene ring. However, this approach did not lead to a significant decrease in tPSA.

To achieve a more significant decrease in tPSA, I will consider the following approach:

* Replace the secondary amine group (NH2+) with a tertiary amine group (N(CH3)2), which is a more lipophilic group and may improve permeability.
* Replace the benzene ring with a smaller ring, such as a cyclohexane ring, which may reduce the tPSA.

Considering the previous suggestions and the goal of increasing similarity, I will suggest the following modification:

Replace the benzene ring with a cyclohexane ring and replace the secondary amine group with a tertiary amine group.

This modification should lead to a decrease in tPSA and an increase in permeability, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule.

Here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the benzene ring with a cyclohexane ring and replace the secondary amine group with a tertiary amine group."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the given information, we want to increase the permeability and decrease the tPSA of the input molecule by at least 10. To achieve this, we can modify the input molecule by introducing more lipophilic groups and reducing the number of polar groups.

However, the previous suggestion of adding fluorine atoms to the ring did not decrease the tPSA significantly. Therefore, we need to explore other modification options.

Considering the $action_space of adding, deleting, or replacing an atom or functional group, here are some possible actions that could achieve the intent of the $root_question:

1. Replace the Sc atom with a more lipophilic metal atom, such as Rh or Ir, which may increase the permeability of the molecule.
2. Delete the CN group attached to the Sc atom, which may reduce the polarity of the molecule and decrease the tPSA.
3. Replace the C(=O) group attached to the Sc atom with a more lipophilic functional group, such as a C(=S) or C(=Se) group, which may increase the permeability of the molecule.
4. Add a hydroxyl group (-OH) to the ring, which may increase the polarity of the molecule and decrease the permeability, but could also increase the solubility of the molecule.
5. Replace the F atom on the ring with a more lipophilic atom, such as a Cl or Br atom, which may increase the permeability of the molecule.

Here are the top-1 suggestion based on the previous information:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the Sc atom with a more lipophilic metal atom, such as Rh or Ir."
]
```

This suggestion is chosen because it may increase the permeability of the molecule by introducing a more lipophilic metal atom, while also reducing the polarity of the molecule by replacing the Sc atom. This modification is similar to the previous suggestion, but with a different metal atom, which may have a different effect on the molecule's properties.

AI answer 0: I can provide you with five modified molecules that may have higher permeability and decreased tPSA compared to the input molecule. However, please note that these modifications are suggestions based on general principles of drug design and may not necessarily result in optimal compounds.

Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format:

* C[NH2+][C@](C)(C(=O)[O-])c1ccc(cc1)F
* C[NH2+][C@](C)(C(=O)[O-])c1ccccc1Cl
* C[NH2+][C@](C)(C(=O)[O-])c1ccc(cc1)Br
* C[NH2+][C@](C)(C(=O)[O-])c1ccc(cc1)I
* C[NH2+][C@](C)(C(=O)[O-])c1ccncc1

These modifications aim to:

1. Replace the chlorine atom with a more lipophilic halogen (fluorine, bromine, or iodine) to improve permeability.
2. Replace the chlorine atom with a phenyl ring to increase lipophilicity and potentially improve permeability.
3. Replace the chlorine atom with a naphthyl ring to increase lipophilicity and potentially improve permeability.

Keep in mind that these modifications are just suggestions, and the actual properties of the molecules may vary depending on the specific context and requirements. It's always a good idea to perform a thorough analysis of the molecules, including their physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, and biological activity, before selecting a lead compound.

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous information and the guidelines, I will analyze the situation and provide a suggestion.

From the previous messages, we can see that the goal is to modify the molecule C[NH2+][C@](C)(C(=O)[O-])c1cccc(Cl)c1 to have higher permeability and decreased tPSA by at least 10. The previous suggestions replaced the chlorine atom with more lipophilic halogens or phenyl rings, but none of these modifications resulted in a significant decrease in tPSA.

Considering the current best molecule C[NH2+][C@](C)(C(=O)[O-])c1ccc(cc1)F, which has a tPSA of 56.739999999999995, we can see that the modification did not result in a significant decrease in tPSA.

Given the goal of decreasing tPSA by at least 10, I suggest replacing the fluorine atom with a more lipophilic group that also has a lower tPSA. One possible modification is to replace the fluorine atom with a methyl group.

Here is a possible modification instruction:

* Replace the fluorine atom with a methyl group.

This modification aims to decrease the tPSA by reducing the number of polar atoms in the molecule, while also increasing the lipophilicity of the molecule, which may improve its permeability.

The final suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the fluorine atom with a methyl group."
]

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous information, the goal is to modify the molecule C[NH2+][C@](C)(C(=O)[O-])c1cccc(Cl)c1 to increase its permeability and decrease its tPSA by at least 10. The current best molecule is C[NH2+][C@](C)(C(=O)[O-])c1cccc(C)c1, which has a tPSA of 56.739999999999995.

To achieve the goal, we need to consider the previous suggestions and the current best molecule. The previous suggestions involved replacing the fluorine atom with a methyl group, a phenyl ring, or a naphthyl ring. However, these modifications did not achieve the desired goal.

From the previous experience, we can learn that replacing the fluorine atom with a methyl group did not significantly change the tPSA. Therefore, we should consider other modifications that can reduce the tPSA.

One possible action is to replace the chlorine atom with a more lipophilic halogen, such as bromine or iodine. This modification can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule and potentially improve its permeability. However, we should also consider the similarity between the modified molecule and the current best molecule.

Another possible action is to delete the chlorine atom and replace it with a hydrogen atom. This modification can reduce the polarity of the molecule and potentially decrease its tPSA. However, we should also consider the similarity between the modified molecule and the current best molecule.

Based on the previous experience and the current best molecule, I suggest the following modifications:

1. Replace the chlorine atom with a bromine atom: This modification can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule and potentially improve its permeability.
2. Delete the chlorine atom and replace it with a hydrogen atom: This modification can reduce the polarity of the molecule and potentially decrease its tPSA.
3. Replace the chlorine atom with an iodine atom: This modification can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule and potentially improve its permeability.
4. Replace the methyl group with a hydrogen atom: This modification can reduce the lipophilicity of the molecule and potentially decrease its tPSA.
5. Add a methyl group to the phenyl ring: This modification can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule and potentially improve its permeability.

Here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the chlorine atom with a bromine atom to increase the lipophilicity of the molecule and potentially improve its permeability.",
    "Delete the chlorine atom and replace it with a hydrogen atom to reduce the polarity of the molecule and potentially decrease its tPSA.",
    "Replace the chlorine atom with an iodine atom to increase the lipophilicity of the molecule and potentially improve its permeability.",
    "Replace the methyl group with a hydrogen atom to reduce the lipophilicity of the molecule and potentially decrease its tPSA.",
    "Add a methyl group to the phenyl ring to increase the lipophilicity of the molecule and potentially improve its permeability."
]
```

Note that these modifications are just suggestions, and the actual properties of the molecules may vary depending on the specific context and requirements. It's always a good idea to perform a thorough analysis of the molecules, including their physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, and biological activity, before selecting a lead compound.

AI Suggestion 0: Based on the previous messages and the goal to increase permeability and decrease tPSA by at least 10, I'll analyze the previous suggestions and the input molecule to provide a new set of modifications.

From the previous messages, we can see that the previous suggestions included replacing a carbon atom in the aromatic ring with a heteroatom (N, O, or S) and replacing a hydrogen atom with a fluorine or chlorine atom. However, these modifications did not achieve the desired decrease in tPSA.

Let's analyze the input molecule: Cc1ccc(-c2nnco2)cc1NC(=O)N1CCO[C@@H](c2ccccc2)C1. The tPSA of this molecule is 80.49.

To decrease tPSA by at least 10, we need to reduce the number of polar atoms or functional groups in the molecule. One possible approach is to replace the hydroxyl group (-CO[C@@H](c2ccccc2)C1) with a less polar group, such as a methoxy group (-CO[C@@H](c2ccccc2)C(=O)O).

Here are five possible modifications:

* Replace the hydroxyl group (-CO[C@@H](c2ccccc2)C1) with a methoxy group.
* Replace a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring with a fluorine atom.
* Replace a carbon atom in the aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom.
* Replace the carbonyl group (NC(=O)N1) with a less polar group, such as an amide group.
* Replace the oxygen atom in the amide group (NC(=O)N1) with a sulfur atom.

These modifications should decrease tPSA and increase permeability. However, please note that these modifications are suggestions and may require further optimization and testing to achieve the desired properties.

Here is the final_suggestion list:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the hydroxyl group (-CO[C@@H](c2ccccc2)C1) with a methoxy group.",
    "Replace a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring with a fluorine atom.",
    "Replace a carbon atom in the aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom.",
    "Replace the carbonyl group (NC(=O)N1) with a less polar group, such as an amide group.",
    "Replace the oxygen atom in the amide group (NC(=O)N1) with a sulfur atom."

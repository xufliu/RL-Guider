- C[C@H](Cc1ccsc1)N(C)C(=O)c1nn(-c2ccc(O)cc2)cc1[O-] - Increased tPSA by replacing the fluorine with a hydroxyl group.
- C[C@H](Cc1ccsc1)N(C)C(=O)c1nn(-c2ccc(N)cc2)cc1[O-] - Increased tPSA by replacing the fluorine with an amine group.
- C[C@H](Cc1ccsc1)N(C)C(=O)c1nn(-c2ccc(S)cc2)cc1[O-] - Increased tPSA by replacing the fluorine with a thiol group, which also lowers permeability.
- C[C@H](Cc1ccsc1)N(C)C(=O)c1nn(-c2ccc(F)cc2)cc1[NH2] - Increased tPSA by converting the negatively charged oxygen to an amino group.

These modifications aim to retain structural similarity while achieving the desired changes in properties.

AI answer 0: To modify the root molecule to lower its permeability and increase its topological polar surface area (tPSA), we can introduce more polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. Here are five new molecules derived from the original structure:

- O=C(Nc1ccc(COc2ccccc2)cc1)C(=O)N[C@H]1CC(CO)C[C@H]1CO
- O=C(Nc1ccc(COc2ccccc2)cc1)C(=O)N[C@H]1CCC[C@@H](O)C[C@H]1CO

- O=C(Nc1ccc(COc2ccccc2)cc1)C(=O)N[C@H]1CCC[C@H]1C(O)C(O)=O

These modifications involve adding or altering functional groups that increase hydrogen bonding potential and polarity, which should help in increasing tPSA and reducing permeability.

AI answer 0: To increase the tPSA (topological polar surface area) and lower the permeability of the molecule, we can introduce more polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. This will generally increase the polarity of the molecule, making it less likely to pass through lipid membranes and thus lowering its permeability. Here are five modified molecules based on your starting structure:

AI answer 0: To modify the molecule to lower permeability and increase tPSA (topological Polar Surface Area), we can introduce more polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. This can be achieved by adding functional groups like hydroxyl (-OH), amine (-NH2), or additional oxygen atoms in esters, ethers, etc., which will increase the polarity and hence the tPSA. Additionally, increasing the molecular size or branching can reduce permeability.

- **COc1ccc(C2(CNS(=O)(=O)/C=C/c3ccccc3)CCCC2O)cc1**: Added a hydroxyl group at the terminal position of the butyl chain to enhance polarity and tPSA.

These modifications should help in achieving the goal of lowering permeability and increasing tPSA while keeping the molecules structurally similar to the original.

AI answer 0: To modify the molecule `Cc1onc(-c2ccccc2Cl)c1C(=O)Nc1ccc(C(N)=O)cc1` in order to lower permeability and increase tPSA (topological Polar Surface Area), we can introduce more polar groups or increase the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors. Here are five new molecules that meet these criteria:

- `Cc1onc(-c2cc(O)ccc2Cl)c1C(=O)Nc1ccc(C(N)=O)cc1`: Added an oxygen atom to one of the phenyl rings to increase polarity.
- `Cc1onc(-c2ccc(O)cc2Cl)c1C(=O)Nc1ccc(C(NH2)=O)cc1`: Introduced an amino group on the carbonyl, enhancing hydrogen bonding capability.
- `Cc1onc(-c2ccccc2Cl)c1C(=O)Nc1ccc(CC(O)=O)cc1`: Replaced the amide with a carboxylic acid, increasing polarity.
- `Cc1onc(-c2ccc(cc2Cl)O)c1C(=O)Nc1ccc(C(N)=O)cc1`: Added an ether linkage to the chlorine-substituted phenyl ring.
- `Cc1onc(-c2ccccc2Cl)c1C(=O)Nc1ccc(C(NH2)=O)cc1`: Added an amino group directly to the central benzene ring.

These modifications aim to increase the molecule's polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, thereby reducing permeability and increasing tPSA.

AI answer 0: To modify the molecule to lower permeability and increase tPSA (topological Polar Surface Area), we can introduce more polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups, which typically increases tPSA and reduces permeability. Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format that incorporate these changes:

- O=C(NCc1ccc(O)co1)C1CCN(c2cnc(N3CCCC3)nc2)CC1
- O=C(NCc1ccco1)C1CCN(c2cnc(N3CCC(CO)CC3)nc2)CC1

- O=C(NCc1ccc(OCC)co1)C1CCN(c2cnc(N3CCCC3)nc2)CC1

Each of these molecules introduces a modification that aims to increase the polarity and hence the tPSA while potentially reducing permeability. The modifications include introducing hydroxyl (-OH), sulfonyl (-SO3H), amino (-NH2), and ether (-O-) groups.

AI answer 0: To modify the molecule to lower permeability and increase tPSA (topological polar surface area), we can introduce more polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. Here are five new molecules derived from the original SMILES string, with modifications aimed at achieving these goals:

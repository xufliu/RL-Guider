AI answer 0: I can provide you with five modified molecules that have higher permeability and lower tPSA compared to the original molecule. However, please note that these modifications are based on general guidelines and may require further optimization and experimental validation.

Here are five modified molecules with their SMILES notations:

• C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1
• C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1
• C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1
• C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no)C1
• C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH+]C1

These modifications include:

* Replacing the nitro group (-no2) with a hydroxyl group (-oh) or removing it to reduce polarity and increase permeability.
* Replacing the sulfur atom with a carbon atom to reduce the molecular weight and increase lipophilicity.
* Replacing the amine group (+NH2) with a hydrogen atom or a less basic group to reduce the molecular weight and increase lipophilicity.
* Replacing the ester group (CO3) with a less polar group such as a methylene group (CH2) to reduce polarity and increase permeability.

Please note that these modifications are based on general guidelines and may require further optimization and experimental validation to ensure that they meet the desired properties and are safe and effective for their intended use.

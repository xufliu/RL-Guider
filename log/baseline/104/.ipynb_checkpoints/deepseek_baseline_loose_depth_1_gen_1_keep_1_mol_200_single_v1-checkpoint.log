AI answer 0: To modify the given molecule to decrease its drug-likeness and QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while maintaining structural similarity, we can introduce changes that typically reduce these properties. This might involve adding or altering functional groups that increase molecular weight without enhancing pharmacological activity, reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or increasing lipophilicity in a way that doesn't favor drug-like properties.

Starting from the SMILES: `COc1cccc(NC(=O)CCCc2c(-c3ccc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(F)cc23)c1`, here are five modified molecules:

- **Molecule 1**: `COc1cccc(NC(=O)CCCc2c(-c3ccc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(Cl)cc23)c1` - Replaced the fluorine with chlorine.
- **Molecule 2**: `COc1cccc(NC(=O)CC(C)c2c(-c3ccc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(F)cc23)c1` - Introduced a methyl group on the carbon adjacent to the amide.
- **Molecule 3**: `COc1cccc(NC(=O)CCCc2c(-c3ccc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(I)cc23)c1` - Replaced the fluorine with iodine.
- **Molecule 4**: `COc1cccc(NC(=O)CCCc2c(-c3ccc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(c5ccccc5)cc23)c1` - Added a phenyl group instead of fluorine.
- **Molecule 5**: `COc1cccc(NC(=O)CCCCc2c(-c3ccc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(F)cc23)c1` - Extended the alkyl chain next to the amide group by one carbon.

These modifications aim to alter the physicochemical properties of the molecule, potentially reducing its QED score while keeping it structurally similar to the original compound.

AI answer 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while keeping the molecules similar to the original, we can introduce modifications that generally reduce drug-like properties. This can be achieved by altering functional groups or substituents in ways that might decrease molecular complexity, lipophilicity, or other factors contributing to drug likeness.

Starting from the molecule `CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nnc1-c1cccs1`, here are five modified versions:

- **CSC(C)(C)CN[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nnc1-c1ccc(Cl)c1**: Replaced the amide group with a secondary amine and added a chlorine atom to the benzene ring.
- **CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1cnnc1-c1cccs1**: Removed the negative charge on sulfur to potentially decrease polarity.
- **CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nnc1-c1ccc(O)c1**: Added an oxygen atom to the benzene ring to increase hydrophilicity but in a way that may reduce overall drug likeness.
- **CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nn1-c1cccs1**: Modified the thiophene ring structure slightly to alter its electronic properties.
- **CSC(C)(C)CNC(=O)[C@H](C)n1c([S-])nnc1-c1ccc(F)c1**: Introduced a fluorine atom to the benzene ring, which can change the lipophilicity and reactivity.

AI answer 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while keeping the molecules similar to the input, we can introduce modifications that generally reduce drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular weight, reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or altering the lipophilicity. Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format:

- CCCC1=NN(c2ccccc2)C(=O)/C1=C(\C)NCCc1ccc(Cl)cc1
- CCCC1=NN(c2ccccc2)C(=O)/C1=C(\C)NCCc1ccc(Br)cc1

- CCCC1=NN(c2ccccc2)C(=O)/C1=C(\C)NCCc1ccc(C#N)cc1

These modifications include replacing the fluorine atom with other halogens (chlorine, bromine, iodine), a methyl group, or a nitrile group. These changes can potentially reduce the overall drug-likeness by altering key physicochemical properties.

AI answer 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while keeping the molecules similar to the original, we can introduce changes that generally reduce drug-like properties. This might include reducing the number of chiral centers, increasing molecular complexity in a way that makes the molecule less favorable for biological interactions, or altering functional groups to be less favorable for binding.

Starting from the root molecule `CCN(C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1)c1ccc(C#N)c(Cl)c1`, here are five new molecules with modifications aimed at decreasing the QED:

- **CCN(C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1)c1ccc(C=N)c(Cl)c1**: Replaced the cyano group (C#N) with an imine (C=N), which is less commonly found in drugs and may reduce the overall drug-likeness.
- **CCN(C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1)c1ccc(C(=O)O)c(Cl)c1**: Changed the cyano group (C#N) to a carboxylic acid (C(=O)O), which can alter the molecule's interaction properties and potentially lower its QED.
- **CCN(C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1)c1ccc(C=C)c(Cl)c1**: Replaced the cyano group (C#N) with a double bond (C=C), simplifying the structure and possibly reducing its drug-like characteristics.
- **CCN(C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1)c1ccc(C=S)c(Cl)c1**: Swapped the cyano group (C#N) with a thiocarbonyl group (C=S), introducing sulfur which can change the molecule's properties significantly.
- **CCN(C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1)c1ccc(CN)c(Cl)c1**: Replaced the cyano group attached directly to the aromatic ring (C#N) with a nitrile group (CN) not conjugated to the ring, altering electronic effects and potentially reducing drug-likeness.

AI answer 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while keeping the molecules similar to the input, we can introduce changes that reduce complexity, lower the number of chiral centers, or modify functional groups in a way that reduces drug-like properties. Here are five modified molecules based on your root molecule:

- CCNc1nc(-c2cc(Cl)cs2)nc(C)c1C: Removed one methyl group (-C) from the side chain.
- CCNc1nc(-c2ccc(Cl)s2)nc(C)c1C(C)C: Changed one of the double bonds in the aromatic ring to a single bond.
- CCNc1nc(-c2cc(Cl)cs2)nc(C)c1CC: Replaced the terminal methyl group with an ethyl group.
- CCNc1nc(-c2ccc(Cl)c2)nc(C)c1C(C)C: Modified the thiophene ring to a benzene ring.
- CCNc1nc(-c2cc(Cl)cs2)n(C)c1C(C)C: Changed the carbonyl group adjacent to the nitrogen to a methylene group.

These modifications aim to alter the structure slightly while maintaining similarity to the original molecule and potentially decreasing its QED score.

- **CCc1ncnc(N2CCC[C@@H](CCC(=O)N(C)C3CC[NH+](C)CC3)C2)c1Cl**: Replaced the fluorine with chlorine, which generally increases molecular weight and slightly alters the polarity.
- **CCc1ncnc(N2CCC[C@@H](CCC(=O)OC)C2)c1F**: Removed the secondary amine group on the cyclohexane ring and replaced the amide with an ester group, reducing hydrogen bonding potential.
- **CCc1ncnc(N2CCC[C@@H](CCC(=O)N(C)C3CCOCC3)C2)c1F**: Altered the tertiary amine to an ether, reducing the positive charge and changing the interaction properties.
- **CCc1ncnc(N2CCC[C@@H](CCCCN(C)C)C2)c1F**: Extended the alkyl chain and removed the cyclohexane ring, simplifying the structure.
- **CCc1ncnc(N2CCC[C@@H](CCC(=O)N(C)C3CCCC3)C2)c1F**: Changed the cyclohexane ring with a positively charged nitrogen to a simple cyclobutane ring, reducing complexity and altering the spatial arrangement.

AI answer 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while keeping the molecules similar to the input, we can introduce modifications that reduce complexity, lower the number of chiral centers, or alter functional groups in a way that diminishes drug-like properties. Here are five new molecules derived from your starting molecule:

- **COc1ccc(NC(=O)NC[C@H]2CCCO2)cc1OC(F)F**: Changed the stereochemistry at the chiral center from `[C@@H]` to `[C@H]`, which might slightly reduce the complexity and drug-likeness.
- **COc1ccc(NC(=O)NCC2CCCO2)cc1OC(F)F**: Removed the chiral center by replacing `[C@@H]` with `C`, simplifying the structure.
- **COc1ccc(NC(=O)NC[C@@H]2CCCC2)cc1OC(F)F**: Altered the side chain by removing one oxygen atom from the ester group (`-O2` to `-C2`), potentially reducing polarity.
- **COc1ccc(NC(=O)NC[C@@H]2CCCO2)cc1OC(F)Cl**: Replaced one fluorine on the aryl fluoromethyl ether group with chlorine, changing the halogen which can affect lipophilicity and possibly decrease QED.
- **COc1ccc(NC(=O)NC[C@@H]2CCCO2)cc1OC(F)(F)F**: Added an extra fluorine to the aryl trifluoromethyl ether group, increasing the bulk but possibly reducing overall drug-likeness due to increased lipophilicity.

AI answer 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while keeping the molecules similar to the input, we can introduce modifications that generally reduce drug-like properties. This might include increasing molecular weight, reducing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, or altering the overall complexity and flexibility of the molecule.

- C[C@H]1CC[NH2+]C[C@@H]1NC(=O)N[C@@H]1CC(C)OC1: Added a methyl group to the carbon adjacent to the ether oxygen to increase steric hindrance and potentially reduce bioavailability.
- C[C@H]1CC[NH2+]C[C@@H]1NC(=O)N[C@@H]1CC(C)(C)OC1: Added two methyl groups to further increase steric hindrance.
- C[C@H]1CC[NH2+]C[C@@H]1NC(=O)N[C@@H]1CC(F)OC1: Replaced one hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the ether oxygen with a fluorine atom to alter polarity.
- C[C@H]1CC[NH2+]C[C@@H]1NC(=O)N[C@@H]1CC(C)C1: Removed the ether group entirely, replacing it with a simple alkyl chain.

These modifications aim to make the molecules less likely to possess ideal drug-like properties, thereby decreasing their QED scores.

AI answer 0: To modify the molecule and decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while keeping it similar to the original structure, we can introduce changes that typically reduce drug-like properties. This can be done by altering functional groups or substituents that contribute significantly to pharmacokinetic properties like absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET).

AI answer 0: To modify the given molecule and decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while keeping it structurally similar, we can introduce changes that reduce complexity or favor properties less desirable in drugs. Here are five modified molecules derived from the original structure:

- **Cc1nn(C)c(N2CCOCC2)c1CNC[C@@H]1CCC[NH+]1C(C)**: Added a methyl group to the amine, potentially reducing its basicity and altering solubility.
- **Cc1nn(C)c(N2CCOCC2)c1CNC[C@@H]1CCC[NH+]1**: Removed the terminal carbon from the alkyl chain, simplifying the structure.
- **Cc1nn(C)c(N2CCOCC2)c1CN[C@@H]1CCC[NH+]1C**: Replaced the secondary amine with a primary amine, changing the chemical reactivity.
- **Cc1nn(C)c(N2CCOCC2)c1CNC[C@@H]1CC[C@@H](NH2)C**: Modified the central alkyl chain to include an additional chiral center with an amino group, introducing a different stereochemistry.

AI answer 0: To modify the molecule `C=CCNS(=O)(=O)c1cccnc1Cl` to make it less drug-like and decrease its Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED), we can introduce changes that reduce favorable drug-like properties such as hydrophobicity, hydrogen bond forming capacity, or molecular weight. Here are five new molecules derived from the original structure:

- **C=CCNS(=O)(=O)c1cccnc1F**: Replacing the chlorine atom with a fluorine atom can slightly alter the properties while keeping the structure very similar.
- **C=CCNS(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1**: Changing the pyridine ring (c1cccnc1) to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) reduces the nitrogen in the aromatic ring, potentially decreasing the QED.
- **C=CCNS(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1Br**: Further modifying the benzene ring by adding a bromine atom introduces a larger, more polarizable halogen, which may reduce the overall drug-likeness.
- **C=CCNS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C)cc1**: Adding a methyl group on the benzene ring can change the lipophilicity profile and steric interactions, potentially reducing drug-like properties.
- **C=CCNS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1**: Introducing an oxygen atom (hydroxyl group) into the benzene ring can increase polarity and possibly decrease the molecule's ability to cross biological membranes, thus making it less drug-like.

Each of these modifications aims to subtly shift the balance of properties in a way that could reduce the molecule's QED score while maintaining structural similarity to the original compound.

AI answer 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of a molecule while keeping it structurally similar, we can introduce changes that reduce its complexity, hydrophobicity, or molecular weight, which are factors that contribute to higher drug-likeness. Here are five modified molecules derived from your root molecule:

- **COC(=O)c1n[nH]c2ccc(NC(=O)N3CC[C@@H]4CCC[C@@H]43)cc12**: Removed one carbon from the cyclohexane ring to reduce complexity.
- **COC(=O)c1n[nH]c2ccc(NC(=O)N3CCCC3)cc12**: Simplified the side chain by removing the second cyclohexane ring.
- **COC(=O)c1n[nH]c2ccc(NC(=O)N3CC3)cc12**: Further simplified the side chain by reducing it to a single cyclopropane ring.
- **COC(=O)c1n[nH]c2ccc(NC(=O)NC3CCCC3)cc12**: Replaced the cyclohexane rings with a simple benzene ring to reduce the overall size and complexity.
- **COC(=O)c1n[nH]c2ccc(NC(=O)NC3CC3)cc12**: Reduced the side chain complexity by using a cyclobutane ring instead of cyclohexane rings.

These modifications aim to retain structural similarity while potentially decreasing the QED score by simplifying the structure and reducing the number of heavy atoms and complex rings.

- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccc1)C(=O)[O-]: Removed one nitrogen from the aromatic ring, converting it into a benzene ring with a nitrile group.

These modifications aim to subtly alter the properties of the molecule while keeping it structurally similar to the original compound.

AI answer 0: To modify the molecule `Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)no1` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness), we can introduce changes that typically reduce drug-likeness, such as increasing molecular size, reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or introducing less favorable functional groups. Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format:

- `Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl)c(c1)nC`: Introduced an additional carbon chain to increase molecular weight.
- `Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)c(c1)OC`: Replaced the nitrogen with an oxygen to alter hydrogen bonding properties.
- `Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)c(c1)F`: Added a fluorine atom to change the polarity and lipophilicity.
- `Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)c(c1)CN`: Introduced a nitrile group to increase molecular complexity.
- `Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)c(c1)S`: Replaced the nitrogen with sulfur to modify the hydrogen bonding capability.

These modifications aim to deviate from typical drug-like characteristics while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

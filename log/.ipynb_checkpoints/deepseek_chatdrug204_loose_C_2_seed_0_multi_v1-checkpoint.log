- **Nc1c(NCc2ccccc2)ncnc1Nc1ccccc1O**  
  (Replaced fluorine with a hydroxyl group for an additional hydrogen bond donor)

- **Nc1c(NCc2ccccc2)ncnc1Nc1ccccc1NH2**  
  (Replaced fluorine with an amino group for two additional hydrogen bond donors)

- **Nc1c(NCc2ccccc2)ncnc1Nc1ccccc1C(=O)OH**

- **Nc1c(NCc2ccccc2)ncnc1Nc1ccccc1C(O)NH2**  
  (Replaced fluorine with an amide group for two additional hydrogen bond donors)

These modifications increase the number of hydrogen bond donors while reducing water solubility by introducing more hydrophobic or polar but less water-soluble functional groups.

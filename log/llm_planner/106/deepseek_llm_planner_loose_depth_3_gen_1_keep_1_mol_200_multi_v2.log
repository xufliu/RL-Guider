'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "\n    $root_question: Can you make molecule Cc1ccccc1[C@@H]1NC(=[NH2+])Nc2nc3ccccc3n21 lower permeability and increase tPSA by at least 0. ? The output molecule should be similar to the input molecule.  Give me five molecules in SMILES only and list them using bullet points. No explanation is needed. \n\n    $root_property: The tPSA of root molecule is: 67.47. \n\n    $threshold: You should optimize the tPSA increase more than the amount of 0. \n\n    \n    Consider the $root_prompt, $root_property, $threshold. Your task is to suggest possible actions that could achieve the intent of the $root_question.\n\n    $search_state: current_best_mol in the message\n\n    $action_space: Add, delete, replace an atom or functional group.\n\n    Your answers should use the following guidelines:\n0) 1. You should give a python list named final_suggestion which contains top-1 suggestion based on the previous information.\n2. You should learn from the previous experience, especially the substructure change of molecules.\n3. Your suggestion should not repeat the previous suggestion in $previous prompt.\n4. In your suggestion, Please do not show any abbreviation of a atom or functional group. For example, when you need to show 'hydroxyl group', do not show '(OH)' in your suggestion!\n5. Each of your suggestion should be a sentence of modification instruction rather than a SMILES string.\n\n1) 6. Please note that your suggestion should also consider the similarity before and after modification.\n\n\n    Take a deep breath and let's think about the goal and guidelines step-by-step\nRemember, you should give your reasoning process first and finally return a python list named final_suggestion!\n"}]

User:Can you make molecule Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)no1 higher permeability? The output molecule should be similar to the input molecule. Give me five molecules in SMILES only and list them using bullet points.
AI:Here are five modified molecules with potentially higher permeability, while maintaining similarity to the input molecule. The modifications focus on reducing polarity, increasing lipophilicity, or simplifying the structure:

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2)no1** (Removed one chlorine atom to reduce steric hindrance and polarity)  
- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(C)c2)no1** (Replaced chlorines with methyl groups to increase lipophilicity)  
- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccccc2)no1** (Removed both chlorines to reduce polarity and steric bulk)  
- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)Cc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)no1** (Shortened the linker to reduce flexibility and improve permeability)  
- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(F)c2F)no1** (Replaced chlorines with fluorines to reduce steric hindrance while maintaining some electronegativity)  

These modifications aim to enhance permeability while preserving the core structure of the molecule.

User:Your provided sequence Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2)no1 is not correct. We find a sequence O=C(Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1)NCCc1cccc(Cl)c1 which is correct and similar to the molecule you provided. Can you give me a new molecule?
AI:Thank you for pointing that out! Based on the corrected sequence **O=C(Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1)NCCc1cccc(Cl)c1**, here are five modified molecules with potentially higher permeability while maintaining structural similarity:

- **O=C(Cc1ccc(C)cc1)NCCc1cccc(Cl)c1** (Replaced one chlorine with a methyl group to reduce polarity)  
- **O=C(Cc1ccc(F)cc1)NCCc1cccc(F)c1** (Replaced chlorines with fluorines to reduce steric hindrance)  
- **O=C(Cc1ccccc1)NCCc1cccc(Cl)c1** (Removed one chlorine to reduce polarity and steric bulk)  
- **O=C(Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1)NCCc1ccc(C)c1** (Replaced one chlorine with a methyl group on the second ring)  
- **O=C(Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1)NCCc1ccccc1** (Removed both chlorines to increase lipophilicity)  

These modifications aim to improve permeability while keeping the core structure intact. Let me know if you'd like further refinements!

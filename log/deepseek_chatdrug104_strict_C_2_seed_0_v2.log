AI:Thank you for the clarification! Here’s a new molecule in SMILES format that is structurally similar to the corrected sequence you provided, but modified to be less drug-like:

**C[C@@H]1CCc2c(sc(NC(=O)[C@H]3CCCN3C(=O)c3ccc(O)s3)c2C#N)C1**  

In this molecule, I replaced the sulfonamide group (`S(=O)(=O)`) with a less drug-like amide (`C(=O)`) and changed the chlorine (`Cl`) to a hydroxyl group (`OH`). This reduces the drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity. Let me know if you'd like further modifications!

AI:Thank you for pointing that out! Here’s a new molecule based on the corrected structure you provided, **O=C1OC(c2ccccc2F)=N/C1=C\c1cc2ccccc2nc1N1CCOCC1**, modified to be less drug-like while maintaining structural similarity. The changes include simplifying the structure and altering functional groups:

**New Molecule:**  
**O=C1OC(c2ccccc2Cl)=N/C1=C\c1cc2ccccc2nc1O**  

### Explanation of Changes:
- Replaced the fluorine (F) with chlorine (Cl) to reduce drug-likeness.  
- Removed the **N1CCOCC1** moiety and replaced it with a simple oxygen (O) to simplify the structure.  

This molecule retains the core scaffold but is less complex and less likely to exhibit drug-like properties. Let me know if you'd like further modifications!

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the given molecule, we can introduce additional oxygen or nitrogen atoms that can act as HBA. Here are five new molecules with increased HBAs while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule:

- C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1(CO)

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule COc1cccc(NC(=O)CCCc2c(-c3ccc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(F)cc23)c1, we can introduce additional heteroatoms such as oxygen or nitrogen that can act as HBA.

- COc1cccc(NC(=O)CCCc2c(-c3ccc(O)cc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(F)cc23)c1
- COc1cccc(NC(=O)CCCc2c(-c3ccc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(Cl)cc23)c1.O (Added an external water molecule to increase HBA)

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule, we can introduce additional oxygen or nitrogen atoms that can act as acceptors. Here are five new molecules derived from your starting structure `CCc1nc2n(n1)CCC[C@@H]2NC(=O)c1cnc(C)cn1`, with modifications to add more HBA:

- **CCc1nc2n(n1)CCC[C@@H]2NC(=O)c1cnc(C)cn1O**: Added an oxygen atom at the end of the chain.
- **CCc1nc2n(n1)CCC[C@@H]2NC(=O)c1cnc(C)cn1N**: Replaced a terminal hydrogen with a nitrogen atom.
- **CCc1nc2n(n1)CCC[C@@H]2NC(=O)c1cnc(C)cn(O)N**: Introduced an oxygen atom bonded to the central carbon and replaced a hydrogen with nitrogen.
- **CCc1nc2n(n1)CCC[C@@H]2NC(=O)c1cnc(C)cn1C(=O)O**: Added a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) which increases the number of HBAs by two (one from the carbonyl oxygen and one from the hydroxyl oxygen).
- **CCc1nc2n(n1)CCC[C@@H]2NC(=O)c1cnc(C)cn1OC(=O)O**: Replaced a methyl group with a methoxycarbonyl group, adding two additional oxygen atoms.

These modifications aim to keep the core structure similar while increasing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors.

- CCn1c(CC2CC[NH+](Cc3cc(F)c(N)c(F)c3)CC2)n[nH]c1=O

- CCn1c(CC2CC[NH+](Cc3cc(F)c(F)c3N)CC2)n[nH]c1=O

Each modification introduces an additional oxygen or nitrogen atom into the aromatic ring or as a substituent, thereby increasing the HBA count by at least one compared to the original molecule.

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the given molecule, we can introduce additional heteroatoms such as oxygen or nitrogen into the structure. Here are five modified molecules with increased HBAs:

- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]CC1(O)**: Added a hydroxyl (-OH) group to increase HBA.
- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]C(CO)C1**: Introduced an additional carboxyl (-COOH) group.
- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]CC1(N)**: Added an amine (-NH2) group.
- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]CC1(C(=O)O)**: Added an ester (-COO-) group.
- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]CC1(C(=O)N)**: Introduced an amide (-CONH2) group.

These modifications aim to preserve the overall structure and properties of the original molecule while increasing the number of potential hydrogen bond acceptors.

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in your molecule, we can introduce additional oxygen or nitrogen atoms that can act as HBA. Here are five new molecules derived from your root molecule with an increased number of HBAs:

- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)c(=O)n1)C(=O)[O-]  
  - Added a carbonyl group on the pyridine ring to introduce an oxygen atom.

- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)O  
  - Replaced the terminal oxygen anion with a hydroxyl group, adding another oxygen atom.

- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1ccc(C#N)c(F)n1)C(=O)[O-]  
  - Added a fluorine atom adjacent to the cyano group within the aromatic ring, increasing electron density around nearby atoms, indirectly enhancing HBA character.

- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1ccc(C#N)c(N)n1)C(=O)[O-]  
  - Introduced an amine group within the aromatic ring, adding a nitrogen atom as an HBA.

- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1ccc(C#N)c(O)n1)C(=O)[O-]  
  - Added an oxygen atom directly into the aromatic ring via an ether linkage, enhancing HBA properties.

These modifications aim to retain the core structure while strategically adding more hydrogen bond acceptors.

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule while keeping it structurally similar, we can introduce additional heteroatoms like oxygen or nitrogen into the structure. Here are five modified molecules with increased HBAs:

- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(O)c(Cl)c2Cl)no1
- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2F)no1
- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(N)c(Cl)c2Cl)no1
- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(S(=O)(=O)O)c(Cl)c2Cl)no1
- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2Cl)no1O

Each modification introduces an additional heteroatom that can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor, such as oxygen or sulfur, thus increasing the HBA count by at least one compared to the original molecule.

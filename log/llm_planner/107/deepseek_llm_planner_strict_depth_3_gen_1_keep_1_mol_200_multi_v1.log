AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Previous Experience**: From the previous suggestions, adding hydroxyl group (OH) increased the HBA count by 1. The addition of other functional groups like methoxy (OC) and carbonyl (OC=O) also increased the HBA count.
3. **Avoid Repetition**: The previous suggestions included adding hydroxyl, methoxy, carbonyl, and other oxygen-containing groups. To avoid repetition, a different functional group should be considered.
4. **Functional Group Selection**: Adding a **carboxyl group** (COOH) is a suitable choice because it contains two HBAs (carbonyl oxygen and hydroxyl oxygen), which ensures an increase in HBA count by at least 1. Additionally, carboxyl groups are common in drug-like molecules and maintain structural similarity.
5. **Modification Site**: The modification should be made at a position that maintains the overall structure and does not disrupt the core scaffold. Adding the carboxyl group to the ring or side chain is feasible.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the ring with a carboxyl group (COOH)."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** Increase the hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining molecular similarity to the input molecule.
2. **Current Best Molecule:** `C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1`.
3. **Previous Attempts:**
   - Adding a hydroxyl group (`C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1O`) did not achieve the goal.
   - Replacing a hydrogen atom on the ring with a carboxyl group (`C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1C(=O)O`) increased HBA to 6.
4. **Action Space:** Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.
5. **Considerations:**
   - The modification should increase HBA by at least 1.
   - The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the input molecule.
   - Avoid repeating previous suggestions.

**Proposed Strategy:**
To increase HBA while maintaining similarity, consider adding functional groups that introduce additional hydrogen bond acceptors. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms are good candidates. A suitable modification would be to add a carbonyl group (C=O) or an ether group (C-O-C) to the molecule, as they are common in drug design and can increase HBA without drastically altering the structure.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carbonyl group to the carbon atom adjacent to the nitrogen in the ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. The goal is to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. The previous candidate molecule `C#CCOc1cc(F)ccc1NC(=O)C(=O)NCCc1ccncc1OC` increased the HBA from 4 to 5 by adding an oxygen atom to the phenyl ring, forming an ether linkage.
3. To further increase the HBA, we need to introduce additional functional groups that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors without drastically altering the structure.
4. A suitable modification would be to replace a hydrogen atom on the phenyl ring with a hydroxyl group, which introduces an additional oxygen atom capable of forming hydrogen bonds.
5. This modification ensures structural similarity and increases the HBA count by at least 1.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the phenyl ring with a hydroxyl group to increase hydrogen bond acceptors."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule by at least 1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Current Best Molecule**: `C#CCOc1cc(F)ccc1NC(=O)C(=O)NCCc1cc(O)ncc1C` with an HBA count of 5.
3. **Previous Modifications**: The hydroxyl group was added to the phenyl ring, increasing the HBA count effectively.
4. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.
5. **Constraints**:
   - Do not repeat previous modifications.
   - Maintain molecular similarity.
   - Increase HBA by at least 1.

To achieve the goal, let's consider adding another hydrogen bond acceptor group to the molecule without disrupting the core structure. A good candidate for this would be to introduce a carbonyl group (C=O) or a sulfoxide group (S=O) in a position that does not disrupt the overall structure.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Replace a hydrogen atom on the ethyl linker (NCCc1ccncc1C) with a carbonyl group to increase hydrogen bond acceptors.**

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the ethyl linker with a carbonyl group to increase hydrogen bond acceptors."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity to the input molecule.
   
2. **Previous Experience**: In the previous attempt, the addition of a hydroxyl group increased the HBA from 3 to 4. The hydroxyl group was added to the aromatic ring, which maintained structural similarity and achieved the goal.

3. **Current Best Molecule**: `CCc1ccc(NC(=O)CN2C(=O)C[C@H](c3ccccc3)Sc3ccccc32)cc1O` (HBA = 4).

4. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.

5. **Strategy**: 
   - To increase HBA further, another polar group that can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor should be added.
   - The new group should be added to a position that does not disrupt the overall structure significantly.
   - Avoid repeating previous modifications (e.g., adding another hydroxyl group).

6. **Possible Modifications**:
   - Add a carbonyl group to the aromatic ring or the side chain.
   - Add a nitro group to the aromatic ring.
   - Add a methoxy group to the aromatic ring.

7. **Best Suggestion**: Add a methoxy group to the aromatic ring, as it introduces an oxygen atom capable of acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor without significantly altering the structure.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a methoxy group to the aromatic ring at the para position relative to the existing substituents."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule. The current best molecule has an HBA of 4, and the root molecule has an HBA of 3. The desired HBA should be at least 5.

2. **Previous Experience**: The previous attempts involved adding a hydroxyl group or a methoxy group to the aromatic ring. Adding a methoxy group increased the HBA successfully from 3 to 4. Thus, adding another methoxy group or a similar functional group is a viable strategy.

3. **Avoid Repetition**: The previous suggestions included adding a methoxy group (`OC`) to different positions on the aromatic ring. To avoid repetition, I will suggest a different functional group that also increases the HBA, such as a carbonyl group (`C=O`).

4. **Similarity**: Adding a functional group like a carbonyl group to the aromatic ring should maintain similarity to the input molecule, as it does not significantly alter the core structure of the molecule.

5. **Guidelines**: The modification instruction should not use abbreviations and should be a clear sentence.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carbonyl group to the aromatic ring at the para position relative to the existing substituents."]

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Goal**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity.  
2. **Previous Actions**: In the previous attempt, the addition of an oxygen atom (O) increased the HBA count from 4 to 5.  
3. **Current Best Molecule**: `CCC[C@H]1CCc2c(sc(NC(=O)c3cccs3)c2C(N)=O)C1O` (HBA = 5).  
4. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.  
5. **Constraints**:  
   - The modification should not repeat the previous suggestion (e.g., adding a single oxygen atom).  
   - The modification should maintain structural similarity.  
   - Each suggestion should clearly describe the change without using abbreviations.  

**Reasoning Process**:  
To increase HBA count while maintaining similarity, we should consider adding functional groups that introduce additional hydrogen bond acceptors. An effective approach would be to add a carboxyl group (which contains two hydrogen bond acceptors: one oxygen from the carbonyl and one from the hydroxyl group). This modification would increase the HBA count by 2, satisfying the threshold of increasing HBA by at least 1. Additionally, this modification preserves the overall structure and similarity of the molecule.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carboxyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen on the thiazole ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The goal is to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule `CCC[C@H]1CCc2c(sc(NC(=O)c3cccs3)c2C(N)=O)C1` by at least 1, while maintaining molecular similarity.

2. **Current State**: The root molecule has an HBA of 4. The previous candidate `CCC[C@H]1CCc2c(sc(NC(=O)c3cccs3)c2C(N)=O)C1C(=O)O` has an HBA of 5, which meets the threshold but needs further optimization for diversity.

3. **Action Space**: We can add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group. Given the need to increase HBA, adding functional groups is the most straightforward approach.

4. **Previous Attempts**: Previous attempts involved adding carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups to various positions. To avoid repetition and ensure diversity, we should consider adding other functional groups that increase HBA.

5. **Similarity**: To maintain similarity, modifications should be made to parts of the molecule that are less critical to its overall structure, such as the alkyl chain or the periphery of the thiazole ring.

6. **New Suggestion**: One potential strategy is to add a carbonyl group to a position where it can participate in hydrogen bonding without disrupting the core structure. Specifically, adding a carbonyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen on the thiazole ring would increase HBA while maintaining similarity.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carbonyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen on the thiazole ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Increase the hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) of the molecule by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Current Best Molecule**: `COC(=O)C(C)(C)[C@H]1CC[NH+](Cc2nc3cc(Cl)ccc3n2C)CCO1` (HBA = 5)
3. **Strategy**: To increase HBA, we can consider adding functional groups that are known to be hydrogen bond acceptors, such as carbonyl, hydroxyl, or ether groups, or replacing existing atoms/groups with ones that introduce more HBA.
4. **Learning from Previous Suggestions**: The previous modifications introduced additional oxygen atoms (e.g., carbonyl, hydroxyl, ether) to increase HBA. We should avoid repeating these exact modifications.
5. **Similarity Constraint**: The new modification should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule, ensuring it remains similar to the original.

**Reasoning**:
- Adding a hydroxyl group to a suitable position (e.g., on the carbon chain) would introduce one more HBA without significantly altering the structure.
- The modification should be placed where it does not interfere with the existing functional groups or the core scaffold.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to the carbon atom at position 2 in the cyclohexane ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Goal Analysis**:  
   - The goal is to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining molecular similarity to the input molecule.  
   - The root molecule has an HBA of 4, and the latest candidate achieved an HBA of 5.  
   - The threshold requires optimizing HBA by more than 1, meaning the HBA of the new molecule should be at least 6.

2. **Previous Experience**:  
   - Adding a hydroxyl group to the cyclohexane ring successfully increased the HBA from 4 to 5.  
   - The modification strategy worked but did not yet meet the threshold of increasing HBA by more than 1.

3. **Considerations for the New Suggestion**:  
   - Avoid repeating previous modifications like adding a hydroxyl group to the cyclohexane ring.  
   - Ensure the modification increases the HBA by at least 1 (to reach HBA = 6).  
   - Maintain structural similarity to the root molecule.

4. **Possible Actions**:  
   - Add a hydrogen bond acceptor group (e.g., carbonyl, ether, or nitrogen-containing group) to a suitable position in the molecule.  
   - Replace a non-HBA group with a hydrogen bond acceptor group.  

5. **Suggestion**:  
   - Add a carbonyl group to the carbon atom at position 4 in the cyclohexane ring. This modification introduces an additional hydrogen bond acceptor and maintains structural similarity.

**Reasoning Process**:  
By adding a carbonyl group to position 4 of the cyclohexane ring, we introduce a strong hydrogen bond acceptor (the oxygen in the carbonyl group). This modification increases the HBA count by 1, bringing the total HBA to 6. Additionally, this change preserves the overall structure of the molecule, ensuring similarity to the root molecule.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carbonyl group to the carbon atom at position 4 in the cyclohexane ring."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Understanding the Goal:** The task is to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity. The root molecule has an HBA of 5, and the previous best candidate achieved an HBA of 6 by adding a hydroxyl group.

2. **Learning from Previous Experience:** The previous successful modification involved adding a hydroxyl group to increase HBA. This suggests that introducing polar functional groups, such as hydroxyl, ether, or carbonyl, can effectively increase HBA.

3. **Avoiding Repetition:** To avoid repeating the previous suggestion, I will focus on different functional groups that can increase HBA, such as ether or carbonyl groups.

4. **Maintaining Similarity:** The modification should be minimal and preserve the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.

5. **Considering Similarity and HBA Increase:** The modification should be strategically placed to maximize HBA increase without significantly altering the molecule's structure.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with a methoxy group to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 compared to the root molecule (HBA = 5), while maintaining molecular similarity.
2. **Current Best Molecule**: `Cc1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1OC(=O)[C@H]1CC(=O)Nc2cc(OC)ccc21` (HBA = 6), which already meets the threshold but may still be improved.
3. **Previous Modifications**: Methoxy groups have been added to the benzene ring, increasing the HBA. Other modifications like hydroxyl groups, halogens, and additional methoxy groups have been tried.
4. **Strategy**:
   - Introduce another hydrogen bond acceptor group to further increase HBA.
   - Ensure the modification maintains molecular similarity.
   - Consider adding a carbonyl group (C=O) as it is a strong hydrogen bond acceptor.
   - The modification should be applied to a position that does not disrupt the core structure of the molecule.
   
### Final Suggested Action:
I will modify the molecule by adding a carbonyl group to the benzene ring, ensuring it introduces an additional hydrogen bond acceptor while maintaining similarity to the original structure.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with a carbonyl group to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's think step-by-step to achieve the goal of increasing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining molecular similarity to the input molecule.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Increase HBA by at least 1 in the molecule `N#Cc1c(NC(=O)c2ccc(Br)nc2)sc2c1CCC2` (HBA = 4) while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Previous Attempts**: In the `$previous_messages`, modifications included adding carbonyl groups, hydroxyl groups, methoxy groups, amino groups, and sulfonyl groups. These increased HBA to 5 or more.
3. **Avoid Repetition**: The previous suggestions already explored adding oxygen-containing functional groups like carbonyl, hydroxyl, and methoxy, as well as nitrogen and sulfonyl groups.
4. **New Strategy**: To further increase HBA while maintaining similarity, consider introducing a different functional group that can act as an HBA, such as a cyano group or a nitro group, at a suitable position.
5. **Position Selection**: The modification should be made at a position that does not disrupt the core structure significantly, such as the benzene ring or the thiophene ring.

### Suggested Modification:
- Replace a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring or the thiophene ring with a nitro group. The nitro group has two strong hydrogen bond acceptors (the two oxygen atoms), which would increase the HBA count considerably.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with a nitro group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To address the task, we need to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule while maintaining structural similarity. From the previous suggestions, adding functional groups like hydroxyl, nitro, amide, carboxyl, and carbonyl were effective in increasing HBA. However, the addition of these groups may significantly alter the molecule's structure and properties. Therefore, we need to consider modifications that minimally alter the core structure while increasing HBA.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Previous Effective Changes**: Adding hydroxyl, nitro, amide, carboxyl, and carbonyl groups increased the HBA.
2. **Structural Similarity**: To maintain similarity, we should add groups to less sterically hindered positions, preferably on the periphery of the molecule.
3. **Non-Repeated Modifications**: The previous modifications included adding groups to the aromatic ring. To avoid repetition, we should consider adding groups to the non-aromatic parts of the molecule.
4. **New Suggestion**: Adding a carbonyl group (C=O) to the cyclohexane ring (attached to N1) would increase HBA without significantly altering the core structure.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carbonyl group to the cyclohexane ring attached to the nitrogen atom (N1) in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The goal is to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **Previous Attempts:** 
   - In the previous attempts, adding a carbonyl group to the cyclohexane ring attached to the nitrogen atom increased the HBA from 2 to 3, which successfully met the threshold. However, the user indicated that this modification did not fully achieve the goal.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The current best molecule is `O=C(NCCC(=O)N1CCCC(=O)C1)[C@H]1C[C@@H]1c1cccc(Br)c1`, which has an HBA of 3.
   - To further increase the HBA, we need to introduce another hydrogen bond acceptor without drastically altering the structure.

4. **Possible Modifications:**
   - Add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring, as it can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor and fits well within the structure.
   - Add a nitro group to the benzene ring, which provides two additional hydrogen bond acceptors.

5. **Selection:**
   - Adding a hydroxyl group is a subtle change that maintains the structural integrity and similarity while increasing the HBA by 1.

**final_suggestion:**
```python
["Add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the problem step-by-step to arrive at the best suggestion:

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining the structural similarity of the input molecule.
2. **Previous Experience**: In the previous attempt, adding a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring successfully increased the HBA by 1.
3. **Avoid Repetition**: The previous suggestion added a hydroxyl group, so this time, we should avoid suggesting the same modification.
4. **Structural Similarity**: The modification should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.
5. **Potential Actions**: Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.

### Suggestions for Achieving the Goal:
- **Add a carbonyl group** to the benzene ring. This would introduce a new hydrogen bond acceptor (the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group) while maintaining structural similarity.
- **Add a nitro group** to the benzene ring, which introduces two new hydrogen bond acceptors (the oxygen atoms in the nitro group).
- **Replace a hydrogen atom** on the benzene ring with an amide group, which would add a hydrogen bond acceptor (the carbonyl oxygen).

#### Why Choose Adding a Carbonyl Group?
- **Increase in HBA**: Adding a carbonyl group increases the HBA by 1, meeting the threshold of at least 1.
- **Similarity**: The modification does not significantly alter the core structure, maintaining similarity.
- **Avoid Repetition**: This suggestion does not repeat the previous addition of a hydroxyl group.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carbonyl group to the benzene ring to increase hydrogen bond acceptors by at least 1."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule `CCNC(=O)c1cccc(NC(=O)NNc2ccc(Cl)nn2)c1` by at least 1, while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Current Best Molecule:** The current best molecule is `CCNC(=O)c1cccc(NC(=O)NNc2ccc(Cl)nn2)c1`, which has an HBA of 5.
3. **Previous Attempts:** Previous modifications involved adding functional groups like hydroxyl, amino, and carbonyl groups to the benzene ring, which successfully increased the HBA but did not achieve the desired threshold.
4. **Action Space:** We can add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group. Given the need to maintain similarity, adding a functional group that introduces more hydrogen bond acceptors is the most viable option.
5. **Strategy:** To further increase HBA, we can consider adding a functional group that introduces multiple hydrogen bond acceptors. A good candidate is the **nitro group**, which has two oxygen atoms capable of accepting hydrogen bonds.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the benzene ring in the molecule to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule.
2. **Previous Attempts**: The previous attempts added carbonyl groups (=O) and nitro groups (N=O) but did not increase the HBA count. This suggests that adding simple carbonyl or nitro groups may not be effective in this context.
3. **Strategy**: To increase HBA, I need to introduce functional groups that are recognized as hydrogen bond acceptors. Potential candidates include hydroxyl groups, ethers, or additional nitrogen-containing groups like amines or amides.
4. **Similarity Consideration**: The modification should be made in a way that does not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. The changes should be localized to specific parts of the molecule to maintain similarity.
5. **Action**: Add a hydroxyl group to the molecule, as it is a strong hydrogen bond acceptor and can be added without significantly altering the core structure.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to the nitrogen atom in the pyrrole ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Reasoning process:
1. **Objective**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Previous Attempts**: The previous suggestions involved adding functional groups like carbonyl, amino, hydroxyl, thiol, and fluorine. However, the HBA count for the modified molecule (e.g., CC(C)[NH2+]Cc1cncc(N2Cc3ccccc3C2=O)n1) remained unchanged at 3.
3. **Analysis for HBA Improvement**: To increase HBA, consider adding functional groups that introduce additional hydrogen bond acceptors without significantly altering the core structure. Examples include adding a nitro group, amide, or ether oxygen.
4. **Structural Similarity**: Ensure the modification does not disrupt the overall structure or key functional groups of the original molecule.

Based on the above, the top suggestion is:

Add an ether oxygen to the aliphatic chain to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors while maintaining structural similarity.

final_suggestion = ["Add an ether oxygen to the aliphatic chain in the molecule."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal of the Task**: The goal is to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule \( \text{CC(C)[NH2+]Cc1cncc(N2Cc3ccccc3C2)n1} \) by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **Previous Attempts**: Previous attempts focused on modifying the aliphatic chain or the aromatic ring system, but none of them successfully increased the HBA count beyond 3. 

3. **Structural Constraints**: The molecule has a complex structure with an imidazole ring, an aromatic benzene ring, and an aliphatic chain. Modifications should aim to preserve these core structural features while introducing additional HBAs.

4. **Potential Modifications**: 
   - **Ether Oxygen**: Ether oxygen is a common HBA that can be introduced without drastically altering the molecule's structure. However, previous attempts to add ether oxygen to the aliphatic chain did not result in an HBA increase beyond 3.
   - **Carbonyl Group**: Introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) is another way to increase HBA. It can be added to the aliphatic chain or the ring system without significantly altering the molecule's overall structure.
   - **Amine Group**: Adding an amine group (NH2) to the aromatic ring or the aliphatic chain can also increase HBA.

5. **Decision**: Given the previous attempts and the need to increase HBA by at least 1, introducing a carbonyl group to the aliphatic chain is a promising option. This modification is likely to increase the HBA count while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carbonyl group to the aliphatic chain in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Reasoning process:
1. The goal is to increase the hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity to the input molecule.
2. From the previous messages, we see that adding a hydroxyl group (`O`) to the molecule successfully increased the HBA from 4 to 5.
3. To avoid repeating previous modifications, we need to consider alternative functional groups that can increase the HBA count. Functional groups like nitro (`NO2`), carbonyl (`C=O`), or amide (`NC=O`) can be good candidates.
4. The structure similarity should be maintained by making changes to peripheral or less sterically hindered regions of the molecule.
5. Based on these considerations, adding a nitro group to the aromatic ring could be a suitable option, as it increases the HBA by 2 (the nitro group has two oxygen atoms that act as HBAs) and maintains structural similarity.

Final suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the aromatic ring at the position opposite to the fluorine atom."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: Increase the hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) of the molecule by at least 1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule. The input molecule has an HBA count of 2.
2. **Previous Experience**: The previous suggestions included modifications like adding a hydroxyl group, amine, or ether group, but some did not meet the HBA increase threshold or were repeated.
3. **Substructure Change**: The input molecule has a carboxylate group (`C(=O)[O-]`) and an amine group (`[NH2+]`). To increase HBA, we can focus on modifying the carboxylate group or the aromatic ring.
4. **Similarity Consideration**: To maintain similarity, the modification should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule, including the chiral center and the aromatic ring.
5. **New Suggestion**: Add a nitro group (`NO2`) to the aromatic ring. The nitro group has two hydrogen bond acceptors (the two oxygen atoms), which will increase the HBA count by 2, meeting the threshold.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the aromatic ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule.
2. **Current Best Molecule**: The previous candidate `Cc1ccc(-c2nnco2)cc1NC(=O)N1CCO[C@@H](c2cccnc2)C1` has an HBA of 6, which meets the threshold.
3. **Previous Modifications**: The previous modifications involved adding an oxygen atom to the phenyl ring, increasing HBA.
4. **Guidelines**: The new suggestion should not repeat the previous modifications and should maintain molecular similarity.

### Suggestion:
- **Replace the methyl group (-CH3) with a hydroxyl group (-OH)**: This modification will increase the number of HBA by 1, as the hydroxyl group is a hydrogen bond acceptor.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methyl group (CH3) with a hydroxyl group (OH)."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule by at least 1, while maintaining structural similarity to the input molecule.

2. **Analysis of Previous Attempts:**
   - The initial molecule had an HBA count of 5.
   - Replacing the methyl group with a hydroxyl group increased the HBA count to 6, which achieved the threshold increase of 1.

3. **Action Space:** Given the constraints, the most effective strategy appears to be adding or replacing functional groups that introduce additional hydrogen bond acceptors.

4. **Potential Modification:** To further increase the HBA count and maintain similarity, a plausible action would be to introduce an additional hydroxyl group into the phenyl ring. This would not only increase the HBA count but also maintain the overall structural integrity of the molecule.

5. **Similarity Consideration:** Adding a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring would preserve the core structure while introducing an additional hydrogen bond acceptor, ensuring structural similarity.

**Top-1 Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one hydrogen atom in the phenyl ring with a hydroxyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining molecular similarity to the input molecule.

2. **Analysis of Previous Suggestions**: The previous modifications involved adding hydroxyl, amine, carbonyl, or methoxy groups to the thiophene ring. These changes successfully increased the HBA by 1.

3. **Avoiding Repetition**: To ensure diversity, I will consider different functional groups or positions for modification that were not used in the previous suggestions.

4. **Molecular Similarity**: The modifications should be subtle to retain the core structure of the molecule. Thiophene and benzene rings are critical for maintaining similarity.

5. **Potential Functional Groups**: I will consider adding groups like nitro, ester, or ether, which are effective HBAs and can be introduced without drastically altering the structure.

6. **Position of Modification**: The thiophene ring is a suitable site, but I will also consider the benzene ring to explore other options.

### Suggested Modification:
Replace a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with a nitro group, as it is a strong HBA and can be introduced without disrupting the molecular similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with a nitro group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: Increase the hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) of the molecule `Cc1cccc(C)c1OC1C[NH2+]C1` by at least 1, while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Current Best Molecule**: `Cc1cccc(C)c1OC1C[NH2+]C1O` (HBA = 2).
3. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.
4. **Previous Modifications**: The previous modifications involved adding an oxygen (O), a carbonyl group (=O), a nitrogen (N), a chlorine (Cl), and a fluorine (F) to the molecule.
5. **New Strategy**: To further increase the HBA while maintaining similarity, consider adding a different functional group that is known to be a hydrogen bond acceptor, such as a nitro group (NO2) or a sulfoxide group (S=O).

Given these considerations, the best action would be to add a nitro group to the molecule, as it contains two hydrogen bond acceptors (the two oxygens in the NO2 group).

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the benzene ring of the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Increase the hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) count of the molecule by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Previous Actions**: In the previous suggestions, functional groups like hydroxyl, nitro, carboxyl, methoxy, and formamide were added to the aromatic ring to increase HBA.
3. **Avoid Repetition**: The suggestions should not repeat the previous functional group additions (e.g., hydroxyl, nitro, carboxyl, methoxy, formamide).
4. **Structural Similarity**: The modification should be subtle and maintain the core structure of the molecule.
5. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.

### Analysis:
- The aromatic ring is a suitable location for adding hydrogen bond acceptors.
- To avoid repeating previous suggestions, alternative functional groups such as carbonyl, ether, or amine can be considered.
- Adding a carbonyl group (C=O) to the aromatic ring would increase the HBA count by 1 while maintaining similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carbonyl group to the aromatic ring at the para position relative to the chlorine atom."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The task is to modify the molecule `CC(C)C[C@@H]([NH3+])c1ccc(Cl)cc1` to increase its hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1. The previous best molecule, `CC(C)C[C@@H]([NH3+])c1ccc(Cl)cc1C=O`, achieved an HBA of 1 by adding a carbonyl group at the para position relative to the chlorine atom.

2. **Learning from Previous Experience**: The previous modifications focused on adding functional groups like hydroxyl, nitro, carbonyl, and ether groups to the aromatic ring. These modifications successfully increased the HBA count without significantly altering the core structure of the molecule.

3. **Considering Similarity**: To maintain similarity, the modification should target the aromatic ring, as previous changes did, and avoid altering the aliphatic chain or the chiral center.

4. **Avoiding Repetition**: The previous suggestions included adding a carbonyl group, hydroxyl group, nitro group, ester group, and amide group. To avoid repetition, we need to consider other functional groups that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors.

5. **Choosing a Suitable Functional Group**: An amine group (not protonated) or an ether group could be considered. However, ether groups have already been suggested. A better option might be to add a sulfoxide group, which contains an oxygen atom that can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor.

6. **Final Decision**: Adding a sulfoxide group to the aromatic ring at the ortho or meta position relative to the chlorine atom could increase the HBA count while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a sulfoxide group to the aromatic ring at the meta position relative to the chlorine atom."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity to the input molecule.
2. **Previous Experience**: In the previous suggestions, modifying the carbonyl group (C=O) or introducing additional carbonyl groups increased the HBA count.
3. **Avoid Repetition**: Previous modifications involved adding carbonyl groups or altering the ester linkage, so I will avoid those and explore other functional groups that can increase HBA.
4. **Structural Similarity**: Introducing functional groups like hydroxyl or nitro, which are small and can be accommodated without significantly altering the core structure, will help maintain similarity.
5. **Action Space**: Add functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, nitro) or replace existing atoms/groups with more HBAs (e.g., replacing a hydrogen with an oxygen).

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors."]

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the problem and approach it step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule. The input molecule has an HBA of 4, and the previous best candidate achieved an HBA of 5.

2. **Previous Attempts**: In the previous messages, hydroxyl groups were added to the aromatic rings to increase the HBA. This approach successfully increased the HBA from 4 to 5.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The new suggestion should not repeat the previous modifications (i.e., adding hydroxyl groups to the aromatic rings).
   - The modification should maintain structural similarity to the input molecule.
   - The change should explicitly state the atoms or functional groups involved without using abbreviations.

4. **Possible Actions**:
   - **Add** a new functional group that increases the HBA.
   - **Replace** an existing group with one that has more hydrogen bond acceptors.
   - **Delete** a group that does not contribute to the HBA and replace it with a more efficient one.

5. **Reasoning**: Since adding hydroxyl groups to the aromatic rings has already been tried, let's consider adding a carbonyl group (C=O) to a non-aromatic part of the molecule. This modification will increase the HBA without significantly altering the structure's overall similarity.

6. **Suggestion**: Replace the methylene group (CH2) in the COC4 part of the molecule with a carbonyl group to increase the HBA while maintaining structural similarity.

Here is the final suggestion in Python list format:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methylene group in the COC4 part of the molecule with a carbonyl group to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule `CCCCc1noc([C@H]2C=CC(=N)S2)n1` by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **Analysis of Root Molecule:** The root molecule has an HBA count of 5. The previous attempt to modify the molecule by replacing the sulfur atom with an oxygen atom in one of the candidates (`CCCCc1noc([C@H]2C=CC(=N)O2)n1`) did not increase the HBA count, as it remained at 5.

3. **Learning from Previous Experience:** The previous modifications focused on replacing the sulfur atom with oxygen or introducing additional oxygen-containing functional groups. However, these changes did not achieve the desired increase in HBA. Therefore, we need to explore other functional groups or modifications that can introduce additional hydrogen bond acceptors.

4. **Exploring Functional Groups:** To increase the HBA count, we can consider introducing functional groups such as carbonyl groups (C=O), nitro groups (NO2), or sulfoxide groups (S=O), which are known to act as hydrogen bond acceptors.

5. **Structural Similarity:** To maintain structural similarity, the modifications should be made in a way that does not significantly alter the core structure of the molecule. Specifically, the modifications should focus on the side chains or substituents rather than the central rings.

6. **Avoiding Repetition:** We should avoid repeating the same modifications as in the previous attempts, such as replacing sulfur with oxygen.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfur atom in the thiazole ring with a sulfoxide group (S=O) to introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor."]
``` 

This modification introduces a sulfoxide group, which increases the HBA count by 1 while maintaining the structural similarity of the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule CCCCc1noc([C@H]2C=CC(=N)S2)n1 by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **Previous Attempts**: 
   - The molecule with a sulfoxide group (S=O) was suggested, but the HBA remained at 5, which did not meet the threshold.
   - The current best molecule is still CCCCc1noc([C@H]2C=CC(=N)S2)n1 with an HBA of 5.

3. **Action Space**: We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups to increase the HBA.

4. **Strategy**:
   - To increase the HBA, we should focus on introducing additional oxygen or nitrogen atoms, as these are strong hydrogen bond acceptors.
   - The modification should be made in a way that preserves the overall structure and similarity to the original molecule.
   - We should avoid repeating previous suggestions, such as simply adding a sulfoxide group.

5. **Reasoning**:
   - The thiazole ring contains a sulfur atom, which can be replaced with a more polar group to introduce additional HBAs.
   - Replacing the sulfur with a nitrogen atom in the thiazole ring could increase the HBA count, as nitrogen is a good hydrogen bond acceptor.
   - This modification preserves the ring structure and maintains similarity to the original molecule.

6. **Final Suggestion**:
   - **Replace sulfur atom in the thiazole ring with a nitrogen atom to introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor.**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace sulfur atom in the thiazole ring with a nitrogen atom to introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. The goal is to increase the hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining the structural similarity of the molecule.
2. The root molecule has an HBA count of 5, and the previous candidate molecule had an HBA count of 4, which did not meet the threshold.
3. From the previous suggestions, modifying the ester group or introducing additional functional groups seems to be a viable strategy.
4. To increase the HBA count, I aim to introduce additional functional groups that are hydrogen bond acceptors, such as carbonyl groups, amino groups, and ether groups.
5. The strategy involves **adding a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen atom** to the benzene ring, which will increase the HBA count by 1.
6. This modification ensures structural similarity as it only introduces a small functional group without altering the core structure.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen atom to one of the benzene rings in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The goal is to increase the hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) of the molecule `CCc1ccc(CNC(=O)C(=O)Nc2ccc(C(=O)OC)cc2)s1` by at least 1 while maintaining similarity to the original structure. The current HBA of the molecule is 5, and the threshold is to increase it by more than 1 (i.e., HBA ≥ 7).

2. **Analyzing Previous Attempts**: 
   - Previous modifications involved adding a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen atom (e.g., `C(=O)OC(=O)`), which increased the HBA to 6. However, this did not meet the threshold of increasing HBA by more than 1.
   - The current best molecule has an HBA of 6, so we need to further modify it to increase the HBA to at least 7.

3. **Identifying Possible Modifications**:
   - **Adding Functional Groups**: To increase HBA, we can add functional groups like hydroxyl, carbonyl, or ether groups, which are known hydrogen bond acceptors.
   - **Substructure Analysis**: The molecule contains two benzene rings and an amide linkage. Adding substituents to these rings or modifying the amide linkage could increase HBA without drastically altering the structure.

4. **Considering Similarity**: The modification should maintain structural similarity to the original molecule, so changes should be localized and avoid introducing large, bulky groups.

5. **Top Suggestion**:
   - **Adding a Hydroxyl Group to the Benzene Ring**: Adding a hydroxyl group to one of the benzene rings will introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor (oxygen atom) without significantly altering the core structure.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to one of the benzene rings in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1 while maintaining molecular similarity.
2. **Previous Success:** In the previous attempt, modifying the molecule by adding a carbonyl group (C=O) to the oxygen in the CCO1 moiety successfully increased the HBA from 3 to 4.
3. **Strategy:** To further increase the HBA without drastically altering the structure, focus on introducing functional groups or atoms that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors. Possible options include:
   - Adding a hydroxyl group (OH), which has a high hydrogen bonding potential.
   - Introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) in a different location.
   - Adding a nitrogen-containing group like an amine (NH2) or nitro (NO2) group.
4. **Similarity Consideration:** The modification should be localized to minimize structural changes and maintain similarity to the original molecule.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydrogen on the nitrogen in the CN group with a hydroxyl group to increase HBA."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule `CCN(CC)C(=O)Cc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)CCC#N)cc1` to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) by at least 1, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule.

2. **Current State**: The root molecule has an HBA of 3. The previous best candidate `CCN(CC)C(=O)Cc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)CCCN=O)cc1` has an HBA of 4, which meets the threshold of increasing HBA by at least 1.

3. **Previous Modifications**: The previous modifications involved adding functional groups like nitroso (`N=O`), hydroxyl (`OH`), and amide (`NC=O`) to the molecule. These modifications increased the HBA by introducing additional oxygen or nitrogen atoms capable of accepting hydrogen bonds.

4. **Action Space**: We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. Given the need to increase HBA, adding or replacing with functional groups that contain oxygen or nitrogen atoms is the most straightforward approach.

5. **Constraints**:
   - The modification should not repeat previous suggestions.
   - The modified molecule should remain similar to the original molecule.
   - The HBA should increase by at least 1.

6. **Suggestion**: Based on the previous successful modifications, I suggest replacing the `CCC#N` group with a `CC=O` group. This would introduce an additional carbonyl oxygen, which is a strong hydrogen bond acceptor, thereby increasing the HBA by 1.

**Reasoning**: The `CC=O` group (acetyl group) is a common functional group that introduces a carbonyl oxygen, which is a strong hydrogen bond acceptor. This modification maintains the overall structure of the molecule while effectively increasing the HBA by 1.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitrile group (CCC#N) with an acetyl group (CC=O) to introduce an additional carbonyl oxygen."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to increase the Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA) of the molecule `CCN(CC)C(=O)Cc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)CCC#N)cc1` by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **Previous Attempts**: Previous modifications, such as replacing the nitrile group with an acetyl group, did not achieve the desired increase in HBA. The HBA remained at 3.

3. **Key Functional Groups**: The current molecule contains a nitrile group (`C#N`), which is a hydrogen bond acceptor. To increase HBA, we can replace this group with a functional group that has more hydrogen bond acceptors.

4. **Potential Modifications**: 
   - **Replace the nitrile group with a sulfonyl group**: A sulfonyl group (`SO2`) contains two oxygen atoms, both of which are hydrogen bond acceptors. This would increase the total HBA by 1 (from 3 to 4).

5. **Similarity Consideration**: The sulfonyl group is a common functional group in drug-like molecules and should maintain structural similarity to the original molecule.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitrile group with a sulfonyl group to introduce two additional hydrogen bond acceptors."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To address the task, let's break down the requirements and reasoning process:

1. **Goal**: Increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule by at least 1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Root Molecule**: `CCO[C@H]1C[C@@H]([O-])C12CC[NH+](CCC(=O)N(C)CCC#N)CC2` with an HBA count of 4.
3. **Previous Attempts**: The previous modifications did not increase the HBA count beyond 4, so we need to explore different modifications.
4. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.
5. **Constraints**: Ensure the molecule remains similar to the original and avoid repeating previous modifications.

### Reasoning Process:
- The molecule already contains multiple functional groups, including an ether, an alcohol, an amide, and a nitrile. To increase the HBA count, we can introduce another functional group that can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor.
- One effective way to increase HBA without drastically altering the structure is to introduce an additional carbonyl group (e.g., aldehyde, ketone, or ester) or a hydroxyl group (which can act as both donor and acceptor but primarily as an acceptor when deprotonated).
- To maintain structural similarity, the modification should be made on a peripheral part of the molecule, such as the alkyl chain or a side group.

### Suggested Modification:
Replace a hydrogen atom in the alkyl chain with a carbonyl group (ketone or aldehyde) or a hydroxyl group. This modification would increase the HBA count by 1.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom in the alkyl chain with a hydroxyl group to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The goal is to increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule `CCO[C@H]1C[C@@H]([O-])C12CC[NH+](CCC(=O)N(C)CCC#N)CC2` by at least 1, while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **Previous Attempts:** Previous attempts involved replacing a hydrogen atom in the alkyl chain with a hydroxyl group, which successfully increased the HBA count to 5 in the molecule `CCO[C@H]1C[C@@H]([O-])C12CC[NH+](CCC(=O)N(C)CC(O)C#N)CC2`. This suggests that introducing a hydroxyl group is a viable strategy.

3. **Avoiding Repetition:** To avoid repeating previous suggestions, we will not propose another hydroxyl group substitution in the same alkyl chain.

4. **Structural Similarity:** To maintain structural similarity, modifications should be made to parts of the molecule that do not drastically alter its core structure.

5. **New Strategy:** Given the success of adding a hydroxyl group in the alkyl chain, we can consider adding a hydroxyl group to another part of the molecule that already contains functional groups, such as the nitrogen-containing ring or the ether linkage.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to the nitrogen atom in the nitrogen-containing ring."]
```

This suggestion aims to increase the HBA count while maintaining structural similarity by targeting a different part of the molecule that already contains functional groups.

AI Planning Prompt 0: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful chemistry expert with extensive knowledge of drug design. '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "\n    $root_question: Can you make molecule CC[C@H](C)C(=O)[C@@H](C)c1ccncc1 with more hydrogen bond acceptors and increase HBA by at least 1. ? The output molecule should be similar to the input molecule.  Give me five molecules in SMILES only and list them using bullet points. No explanation is needed. \n\n    $root_property: The HBA of root molecule is: 2. \n\n    $threshold: You should optimize the HBA increase more than the amount of 1. \n\n    \n    Consider the $root_prompt, $root_property, $threshold. Your task is to suggest possible actions that could achieve the intent of the $root_question.\n\n    $search_state: current_best_mol in the message\n\n    $action_space: Add, delete, replace an atom or functional group.\n\n    Your answers should use the following guidelines:\n0) 1. You should give a python list named final_suggestion which contains top-1 suggestion based on the previous information.\n2. You should learn from the previous experience, especially the substructure change of molecules.\n3. Your suggestion should not repeat the previous suggestion in $previous prompt.\n4. In your suggestion, Please do not show any abbreviation of a atom or functional group. For example, when you need to show 'hydroxyl group', do not show '(OH)' in your suggestion!\n5. Each of your suggestion should be a sentence of modification instruction rather than a SMILES string.\n\n1) 6. Please note that your suggestion should also consider the similarity before and after modification.\n\n\n    Take a deep breath and let's think about the goal and guidelines step-by-step\nRemember, you should give your reasoning process first and finally return a python list named final_suggestion!\n"}]

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) in the molecule while keeping it structurally similar to the original, we can introduce additional amine groups or hydroxyl groups, which are common HBDs. Here are five new molecules with increased HBD:

- C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH3+]C1: Added a proton to the existing amine group to ensure it remains a strong HBD.
- C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)N(C1)C: Introduced an additional amine group attached to the cyclohexane ring.
- C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C(O)C1: Added a hydroxyl group to the cyclohexane ring to increase HBD.
- C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1(O): Placed a hydroxyl group on the terminal carbon of the cyclohexane ring.

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) in your molecule, we can add functional groups that contain hydrogen atoms bonded to highly electronegative atoms like nitrogen or oxygen. This typically includes primary amines (-NH2), secondary amines (-NHR), alcohols (-OH), and thiols (-SH). Given the structure you provided, here are five new molecules with an increased number of HBDs:

- C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)on1)[C@H]1CCCO1.N
- C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)on1)[C@H]1CCCO1.O
- C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)on1)[C@H](O)CCCO1
- C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)on1)[C@@H](O)CCCO1
- C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)on1)[C@H]1CCC(O)O1

However, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the formatting of the modifications. Let's correct this and provide proper SMILES for five new molecules with at least one additional hydrogen bond donor:

- **C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)on1)[C@H](O)CCCO1** - Added an alcohol group (-OH).
- **C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)on1)[C@H]1CCCC(O)O1** - Replaced the terminal oxygen with a hydroxyl group (-OH).
- **C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)on1)[C@H]1CCCN1** - Added an amine group (-NH2) on the chain.
- **C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)on1)[C@H](O)CCCN1** - Added both an alcohol (-OH) and an amine (-NH2) group.
- **C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)on1)[C@H](N)CCCO1** - Added an amine group (-NH2).

These modifications aim to introduce additional hydrogen bond donors while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) in your molecule, we can add functional groups that contain nitrogen or oxygen atoms capable of forming hydrogen bonds. For this task, I will introduce additional amine or hydroxyl groups to the structure while trying to maintain similarity to the original molecule.

Here are five modified molecules with increased HBD:

- CCC[C@@H](C)[C@H]1CC[NH2+]C[C@@H]1Cc1ccc(O)cc1
- CCC[C@@H](C)[C@H]1CC[NH2+]C[C@@H]1Cc1ccc(NH2)cc1
- CCC[C@@H](C)[C@H]1CC[NH2+]C[C@@H]1Cc1c(O)c(O)c(C)c1
- CCC[C@@H](C)[C@H]1CC[NH2+]C[C@@H]1Cc1c(NH2)c(NH2)c(C)c1
- CCC[C@@H](C)[C@H]1CC[NH2+]C[C@@H]1Cc1c(O)c(C)c(O)c1

Each of these molecules has been altered by adding one or more hydroxyl (-OH) or amine (-NH2) groups to the benzene ring or other parts of the structure, thereby increasing the number of potential hydrogen bond donors.

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) in the molecule O=C(CN1C(=O)CCC1=O)NCCc1ccccc1, we can introduce functional groups that contain hydrogen atoms bonded to highly electronegative atoms like nitrogen or oxygen. This will enhance the molecule's ability to form hydrogen bonds as a donor. Here are five modified molecules with increased HBDs:

- O=C(CN1C(=O)CCC1=O)NCCc1ccc(O)cc1
- O=C(CN1C(=O)CCC1=O)NCCc1ccc(NH2)cc1
- O=C(CN1C(=O)CCC1=O)NCCc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)O)cc1
- O=C(CN1C(=O)CCC1=O)NCCc1ccc(CN2CCOCC2)cc1
- O=C(CN1C(=O)CCC1=O)NCCc1ccc(CN2CCNC2)cc1

Each of these modifications introduces at least one additional hydrogen bond donor compared to the original molecule.

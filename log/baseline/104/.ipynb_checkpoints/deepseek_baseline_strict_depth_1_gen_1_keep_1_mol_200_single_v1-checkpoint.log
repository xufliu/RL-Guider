AI answer 0: To modify the given molecule and decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while keeping it structurally similar, we can make small changes that typically reduce drug-like properties. These changes might include reducing complexity, increasing molecular weight, or altering functional groups to less favorable ones for drug activity. Here are five modified molecules:

- **C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)[NH]C1**: Replaced the ammonium group `[NH2+]` with an amine group `[NH]`, which may reduce the overall charge and polarity.
- **C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)no2)C1**: Removed the ammonium/amino group entirely, simplifying the structure.
- **C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO3)nO2)C1**: Changed the nitroso group `no2` to a nitro group `nO2`, which can increase molecular weight and alter electronic properties.
- **C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSOCO3)no2)[NH2+]C1**: Modified the ether group `O` in the side chain to a ketone `=O`, changing the oxygen's connectivity from single to double bond.
- **C1CC[C@@H](CCc2nc([C@@H]3CSCCO)no2)[NH2+]C1**: Shortened the side chain by removing one oxygen from the ester group, potentially decreasing the molecular weight and complexity.

These modifications aim to keep the molecules structurally close to the original while altering specific features to likely reduce their drug-likeness scores.

AI answer 0: To decrease the drug-likeness and QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule, we can introduce modifications that typically reduce these properties, such as increasing molecular weight without improving potency, reducing lipophilicity, or introducing unfavorable functional groups. Here are five modified molecules derived from your provided structure:

- CCC[C@H]1CN(C(=O)[C@@H]2COc3ccc(F)cc32)CCO1
- CCC[C@H]1CN(C(=O)[C@@H]2COc3ccc(Cl)cc32)CCO1

- CCC[C@H]1CN(C(=O)[C@@H]2COc3ccc(S)cc32)CCO1

These modifications involve changing the bromine atom to other halogens (fluorine, chlorine, iodine), which generally alter the physical properties and potentially reduce the QED score. Additionally, introducing a phenyl group or sulfur changes the molecular interactions and complexity, which can also impact the drug-likeness.

AI answer 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule while keeping it structurally similar, we can introduce modifications that reduce the overall drug-like properties. This can be achieved by altering functional groups or substituents that contribute significantly to the drug-likeness without drastically changing the molecular framework.

Starting from the current_best_mol: `C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccco2)on1)[C@H]1CCCO1`, here are five modified molecules:

- `C[C@H](NC(=O)c1ccc(-c2ccco2)n1)[C@H]1CCCO1`: Changed the oxygen in the aromatic ring to nitrogen to alter electronic properties.
- `C[C@H](NC(=O)c1cc(-c2ccc(C)o2)n1)[C@H]1CCCO1`: Added a methyl group to the aromatic ring to increase bulk and potentially lower solubility.
- `C[C@H](NC(=O)c1ccc(-c2ccco2)o1)[C@H]1CCCO1`: Rearranged the oxygen and nitrogen positions in the heterocyclic ring to change the polarity.
- `C[C@H](NC(=O)c1ccc(-c2ccco2)n1)[C@@H]1CCCO1`: Altered the stereochemistry at one chiral center to affect the interaction with biological targets.
- `C[C@H](NC(=O)c1ccc(-c2ccc(Cl)o2)n1)[C@H]1CCCO1`: Replaced a hydrogen on the aromatic ring with a chlorine atom to increase molecular weight and reduce lipophilicity.

These modifications aim to subtly alter the properties of the molecule to reduce its drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity.

- CC[NH2+][C@@H](Cc1cnn(C)c1)C1(N(C)C)CCCF1

These modifications include:
- Introducing an oxygen atom in a ring (first molecule), which can disrupt some of the favorable interactions.
- Removing one carbon from the alkyl chain (second molecule), reducing the molecular weight.
- Adding an ether group (third molecule), which might affect the lipophilicity.
- Incorporating a nitrogen at the end of the chain (fourth molecule), potentially altering the charge distribution and polarity.
- Substituting a fluorine atom (fifth molecule), which can significantly alter the electronic properties without greatly changing the size.

Each of these changes aims to subtly shift the properties of the molecule, likely decreasing its QED score.

AI answer 0: To modify the given molecule and decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while keeping it structurally similar, we can introduce changes that generally reduce drug-like properties. This might involve simplifying the structure, reducing the number of chiral centers, or altering functional groups to less favorable ones for drug properties.

Starting from the molecule `O=C1C[C@@H](c2ccccc2)c2scc(-c3cccc(F)c3)c2N1`, here are five new molecules with modifications aimed at decreasing the QED:

- **O=C1CC(c2ccccc2)c2scc(-c3cccc(F)c3)c2N1**: Removed the chiral center `[C@@H]` to simplify the structure.
- **O=C1C[C@@H](c2ccccc2)c2sc(-c3cccc(F)c3)c2N1**: Changed the thiophene ring `scc` to a simpler thioether bond `sc`.
- **O=C1C[C@@H](c2ccccc2)c2scc(-c3cccc(I)c3)c2N1**: Replaced the fluorine atom with an iodine atom, which is less common in drugs.
- **O=C1C[C@@H](c2ccccc2)c2scc(-c3cccc(Cl)c3)c2N1**: Replaced the fluorine atom with a chlorine atom, also altering the halogen.
- **O=C1C[C@@H](c2ccccc2)c2scc(-c3ccc(O)c3)c2N1**: Replaced the fluorine-substituted phenyl group with a hydroxyl-substituted phenyl group, introducing a more polar group but less commonly associated with high drug efficacy.

AI answer 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule, we can introduce modifications that typically reduce drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular size or complexity in a way that doesn't favor bioavailability, or by altering functional groups that contribute less to therapeutic effects but more to undesirable properties. Here are five modified molecules:

- **CCOc1cc2c(cc1OCC)[C@H]([C@H](C)CCC)[NH2+]CC2**: Increased the alkyl chain length from CC to CCC on one of the carbons.
- **CCOc1cc2c(cc1OCC)[C@H]([C@H](C)CC)N(CC2)C**: Replaced the [NH2+] with N and added an extra carbon to increase the molecular weight and complexity.
- **CCOc1cc2c(cc1OCC)[C@H]([C@H](C)CC)NC(C)CC2**: Introduced a methyl group on the nitrogen to alter the charge distribution and add bulk.
- **CCOc1cc2c(cc1OCC)[C@H]([C@H](C)CC)OC(C)CC2**: Changed the amino group to an ether linkage, which can reduce hydrogen bonding and change solubility properties.
- **CCOc1cc2c(cc1OCC)[C@H]([C@H](C)CC)SCC2**: Replaced the amino group with a thioether group, which can significantly alter the chemical reactivity and biological activity.

These modifications aim to subtly shift the properties of the molecule away from those typically associated with high drug-likeness, potentially reducing the QED score as requested.

- **C=CCOc1ccc(CN2Cc3ccccc3C[C@@H]2c2nn(C)c2)cc1Cl**: Modified the heterocyclic ring by replacing the oxygen with a carbon, reducing the presence of potentially reactive oxygen atoms.
- **C=CCOc1ccc(CN2Cc3ccccc3C[C@@H]2c2nn(C)C(=O)O2)cc1Cl**: Introduced a carboxylic acid group, which can increase molecular weight and complexity, potentially lowering QED.
- **C=CCOc1ccc(CN2Cc3ccccc3C[C@@H]2c2nn(C)c2F)cc1Cl**: Added a fluorine atom to the heterocyclic ring, introducing a halogen that can alter the molecule's properties significantly.
- **C=CCOc1ccc(CN2Cc3ccccc3C[C@@H]2c2nn(C)c2Br)cc1Cl**: Substituted a bromine atom for hydrogen in the heterocyclic ring, increasing molecular weight and possibly decreasing drug likeness due to the introduction of a heavier halogen.

Starting from the molecule `CCN(CC)C(=O)C1CCN(C(=O)NCCCc2c(C)noc2C)CC1`, here are five modified structures:

- **CCN(CC)C(=O)C1CCN(C(=O)NCCCC)CC1**: Removed the benzene ring with a nitro group to simplify the structure.

- **Cc1cc(C)c(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccc(O)c3ccc23)c(C)c1**: Simplified the fused benzene ring system by removing one carbon from the third ring.
- **Cc1cc(C)c(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccc(O)c2)c(C)c1**: Eliminated the fused ring structure entirely, reducing complexity and potentially decreasing lipophilicity.
- **Cc1cc(C)c(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccc(O)c2)c1**: Changed the overall structure by closing the outer benzene ring differently, simplifying the structure.
- **Cc1cc(C)c(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccc(O)c2)c(C)c1C**: Added an extra methyl group to increase branching but reduced the complexity of the aromatic system by removing one of the fused rings.

These modifications aim to reduce the complexity and potentially lower the QED score while keeping the molecules structurally similar to the original.

AI answer 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) while maintaining structural similarity, we can introduce modifications that reduce the overall drug-like properties of the molecule. This can be achieved by altering functional groups or stereochemistry in a way that diminishes favorable interactions with biological targets or increases molecular complexity without enhancing efficacy. Here are five modified molecules derived from your root_molecule:

- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]CC1**: Changed the chirality at the chiral center to potentially reduce the affinity for specific protein targets.
- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH]CC1**: Removed the charge from the amine group to reduce ionic interactions and possibly lower solubility.
- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CCNC1**: Replaced the charged amine with a neutral nitrile group to decrease polarity and potential reactivity.
- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CCOC1**: Introduced an ether linkage instead of the amide bond to alter hydrogen bonding capabilities and lipophilicity.
- **CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CCCC1**: Simplified the secondary amine structure to a non-substituted amine, reducing complexity and potential interactions.

These modifications aim to subtly alter the properties of the molecule to decrease its drug-likeness while keeping it structurally similar to the original compound.

AI answer 0: To decrease the drug-likeness and QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule, we can introduce modifications that generally reduce the overall complexity, lipophilicity, or number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors. Here are five new molecules with slight modifications to achieve this goal:

- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)O: Replaced the negatively charged oxygen [O-] with a neutral ester group -O.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1ccc(C#N)cn1)C(=O)O: Changed one of the aromatic carbons to a nitrogen to alter the ring structure slightly.
- CC(C)C(Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)O: Removed the chiral center by replacing [C@H] with C.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)cnc1)C(=O)O: Modified the aromatic ring by changing one carbon to a nitrogen to create a pyridine-like structure.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1ccc(C#N)cc1)C(=O)O: Altered the heterocyclic ring system by changing the position of the nitrogen atom.

Each modification aims to subtly change properties that influence drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

AI answer 0: To decrease the drug-likeness and QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule while keeping it structurally similar, we can make subtle changes that reduce its complexity or favor less favorable physicochemical properties. Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format:

- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2Cl)no1
- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2)no1
- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2F)no1
- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2Br)no1
- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2)nc1

Each of these modifications slightly alters the structure, potentially reducing the drug-likeness by introducing less favorable substituents or simplifying the structure, which could lead to a decrease in QED.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while lowering permeability and maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size without drastically altering the core structure. From the previous suggestions, it appears that simply adding alkyl chains does not sufficiently increase the tPSA. Instead, we should consider adding more polar functional groups like hydroxyl groups or ethers, which can increase tPSA more effectively.

Given the constraints and previous attempts, a promising approach would be to add a hydroxyl group to the existing structure in a position that does not significantly alter its overall shape but contributes to higher tPSA.

Here is the reasoning process leading to the final suggestion:

1. The original molecule has a tPSA of 80.32.
2. The target is to increase tPSA by at least 10 units, so the new tPSA should be at least 90.32.
3. Previous modifications did not achieve this target, indicating the need for more polar additions.
4. Adding a hydroxyl group can increase polarity and thus tPSA more effectively than extending carbon chains.

Based on this analysis, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring adjacent to the fluorine atom."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. The previous attempts have not achieved the desired tPSA increase, so we need to explore more effective modifications.

Given that adding oxygen atoms (hydroxyl groups) has been a strategy, let's consider further increasing the number or placement of these groups in positions that do not drastically alter the molecular structure but can significantly impact the tPSA.

Here are the reasoning steps:
1. Adding more hydroxyl groups to increase polarity and tPSA.
2. Ensuring that the modifications do not overly disrupt the core structure to maintain similarity.
3. Avoiding previously suggested changes to ensure new and potentially more effective modifications.

Based on this, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring at the meta position relative to the fluorine atom."
]
```

This modification should help in increasing the tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. Given the previous attempts did not sufficiently alter the tPSA, we should explore more significant changes that still preserve the core structure.

From the previous suggestions:
- Replacing Cl with F did not change the tPSA.
- Introducing sulfur (S) and attaching additional groups like methyl (-C), hydroxyl (-O), and carboxyl (-CO) also did not significantly impact the tPSA as intended.

Considering these outcomes, a more effective approach might involve introducing larger polar groups or multiple polar groups in strategic positions to ensure a notable increase in tPSA without drastically altering the molecular framework.

Here is a potential modification:

- Add an amine group to the benzene ring opposite the nitroso group (N=O). This addition introduces a new polar group that can significantly increase the tPSA and reduce permeability due to increased hydrogen bonding capability.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add an amine group to the benzene ring opposite the nitroso group."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of lowering permeability and increasing tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size in a way that does not drastically alter the core structure. Based on the previous suggestions, which did not significantly change the tPSA, we should explore adding more polar functionalities or larger groups.

Given that the current best molecule has a tPSA of 63.25 and we aim for an increase of at least 10 units, we need to introduce changes that are more substantial in terms of polarity or size. Here’s a reasoned approach:

- Adding a hydroxyl group can increase polarity and potentially increase tPSA.
- Introducing a carboxylic acid group can also enhance polarity and increase tPSA.
- Replacing smaller substituents with larger, more polar groups can help achieve the desired increase in tPSA.

Considering these points, here is a suggestion that adheres to the guidelines and aims to achieve the desired properties:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the chlorine atom attached to the benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group."
]
```

This modification introduces a significant polar group that should increase the tPSA sufficiently while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size in a way that does not drastically alter the structure. Based on the previous attempts, we have learned that adding sulfur oxides can effectively increase tPSA. However, we should explore other modifications to avoid repeating previous suggestions.

Given that the last successful modification was the introduction of SO2, which increased tPSA from 62.77 to 72.0, we can try introducing an additional oxygen atom to the sulfur group or replacing the sulfur with a nitrogen-containing group, which could also enhance polarity and thus tPSA.

Here is a step-by-step reasoning for a new suggestion:
- Introducing a hydroxyl group (-OH) to the benzene ring can increase tPSA without significantly changing the overall structure.
- Adding an amine group (-NH2) to the benzene ring can also increase tPSA.
- Replacing the sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom in the thiazolidine ring can introduce a more polar group, potentially increasing tPSA further.

Considering the guidelines and avoiding repetition, the most suitable action would be to add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring.

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring."
]
```

This modification aims to increase tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original compound.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. The previous attempts did not meet the tPSA increase requirement, indicating that more substantial changes might be necessary.

Given that the root molecule's tPSA is 84.5 and we need an increase of at least 10 units, the target tPSA should be around 94.5 or higher. The previous modifications introduced alkoxy groups which decreased the tPSA, suggesting that these changes were not effective in achieving the desired increase.

To address this, we can consider adding additional polar groups such as amines, hydroxyls, or carboxylates that are known to increase tPSA. Additionally, extending the chain length of existing polar groups could also help. We should avoid repeating previously suggested modifications and ensure that the new molecule remains structurally similar to the original.

Based on these considerations, here is a suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring attached to the amide group."
]
```

This modification aims to increase the polarity and thus the tPSA of the molecule without drastically altering its structure.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to carefully add polar groups that can increase the tPSA without drastically altering the structure. Based on previous attempts, adding a hydroxyl group directly to the benzene ring attached to the amide group did not meet the target. Therefore, we should consider adding more polarizable groups or additional hydroxyl groups in strategic positions.

Given the current best molecule `CCc1ccc(CNC(=O)C(=O)Nc2ccc(C(=O)OC)cc2)s1` and the need to avoid repeating previous suggestions, one effective approach is to add an additional hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring that already contains the ester group. This modification should increase the tPSA sufficiently while keeping the molecule similar to the original.

Here's the reasoning process:
- Adding a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring with the ester increases polarity and tPSA.
- This change maintains structural similarity to the original molecule.
- It avoids previously unsuccessful modifications like adding a hydroxyl group to the other phenyl ring.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring that contains the ester group (C(=O)OC), specifically on one of the carbon atoms adjacent to the ester."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule CC[C@H](C)C(=O)[C@@H](C)c1ccncc1, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups without drastically altering the structure. From the previous attempts, we can observe that adding oxygen (hydroxyl group), sulfur (thiol group), and nitrogen (amine group) increases the tPSA but does not significantly change the overall structure.

Given that the current best molecule has a tPSA of 37.3, which is an increase from the original 29.96, we should aim for further modifications that could potentially push the tPSA higher. However, we must avoid repeating the previous suggestions and ensure that the new molecule remains similar to the original.

Considering these points, one effective approach would be to introduce an additional hydroxyl group in a position that does not disrupt the core structure but contributes to a higher tPSA.

Here's the reasoning process leading to the final suggestion:

- The original molecule has a benzene ring with a pyridine-like structure.
- Adding another hydroxyl group could increase the tPSA further.
- To maintain similarity, the new hydroxyl group should be added to the existing aromatic ring or nearby.

Based on this, the final suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen in the aromatic ring."
]
```

This modification aims to increase the polarity and hence the tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. Given the previous attempts did not change the tPSA from the root molecule, we should explore more significant changes in functional groups that can enhance polarity without drastically altering the molecular structure.

Here are the steps for reasoning:
1. The previous modifications did not affect the tPSA, indicating that the changes were not substantial enough to alter the polar surface area.
2. We should focus on adding or modifying functional groups that significantly contribute to the tPSA.
3. Introducing additional oxygen atoms or nitrogen atoms with hydrogen bonds can increase the tPSA effectively.
4. Ensure that the changes maintain the overall structure and similarity to the original molecule.

Based on these considerations, here is a suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the sulfur atom connected to the benzene ring with an oxygen atom and add a hydroxyl group to the carbon adjacent to this oxygen."
]
```

This modification introduces a new oxygen atom and a hydroxyl group, which should increase the tPSA significantly while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups without drastically changing the molecular structure. The previous attempts have not significantly altered the tPSA from the root molecule's value of 44.7. Therefore, we should explore adding or replacing groups with more polar functionalities that can increase tPSA effectively.

Given the constraints and the need to avoid repeating previous suggestions, one effective approach is to introduce an amide group in a position that does not disrupt the overall structure but contributes to higher polarity and lower permeability.

Here’s the reasoning process:
- Introducing a hydroxyl group or an additional amide bond can increase the tPSA.
- Adding these groups in positions that are less likely to affect the core structure will help maintain similarity.

Based on this, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the fluorine atom on the benzene ring with a hydroxyl group."
]
```

This modification introduces a polar hydroxyl group, which is expected to increase the tPSA and decrease permeability, aligning with the objective.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. The previous attempts did not change the tPSA significantly, so we should look for more substantial changes.

Given that the original molecule has a tPSA of 85.86 and we need an increase of at least 10, we should focus on adding functional groups that are known to increase polarity and thus tPSA, such as additional hydroxyl groups, amides, or amines.

Here’s a reasoning process for a new suggestion:
- Adding a hydroxyl group can increase the tPSA without drastically changing the structure.
- Modifying existing amide or amine groups to add extra functionality can also help.

Based on these considerations, here is a new suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen in the ammonium group."
]
```

This modification introduces a polar hydroxyl group, which should increase the tPSA sufficiently while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups without drastically changing the structure. Based on the previous attempts, adding a hydroxyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen in the ammonium group did not significantly increase the tPSA. We need to explore other positions for introducing polar groups or consider adding multiple polar groups.

Given that the current best molecule is CCO[C@@H]1CCC[NH+](CC(=O)NC(N)=O)C1 and its tPSA is 85.86, we need to increase this value by more than 10 units. One effective approach could be to add an additional hydroxyl group to another part of the molecule, particularly to a carbon that is not directly involved in critical interactions but can still influence the overall polarity.

Let's consider adding a hydroxyl group to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group in the amide bond, which should increase the tPSA without altering the core structure too much.

Here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group in the amide bond."
]
```

This modification aims to increase the polarity of the molecule further, potentially raising the tPSA sufficiently while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size slightly. The previous attempts did not significantly alter the tPSA, indicating that more substantial changes are necessary.

Given the root molecule `Cc1[nH]c2c(C)ccc(C)c2c1CC(=O)N1CCC(N2CCOCC2)CC1` and its tPSA of 48.57, we need to focus on adding polar functional groups that can increase the tPSA without drastically changing the overall structure. Introducing an additional oxygen atom in a form of a hydroxyl group or an ether linkage can help achieve this goal.

Let's consider the following modification:

- Adding a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms that currently has only hydrogen substituents. This addition will increase the polarity and thus the tPSA.

Based on these considerations, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the carbon atom attached to the nitrogen in the amide group (next to the carbonyl group)."
]
```

This modification should increase the tPSA sufficiently while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups which can increase the tPSA without drastically changing the molecular structure. From the previous suggestions and their properties, we observe that introducing a nitrogen atom in place of a carbon (as in the first suggestion) increased the tPSA from 44.1 to 46.33, which is a positive direction but not sufficient to meet the threshold.

Given this, we should look for more polar functional groups or additional substitutions that could further increase the tPSA. Since we have already tried substituting with N, O, S, CO, and CN, let's consider adding an amide group or another hydroxyl group, as these are known to increase tPSA significantly due to their high polarity.

Here’s a reasoned approach:

- Adding another amide group or a hydroxyl group can increase the polarity and hence the tPSA.
- We should avoid repeating previously suggested modifications and ensure the new molecule remains structurally similar.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace one of the chlorine atoms with a hydroxyl group."
]
```

This modification introduces a highly polar hydroxyl group, which should significantly increase the tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size without drastically changing the core structure. The previous attempts did not change the tPSA as expected, indicating that more significant changes might be necessary. However, these changes should still preserve the overall structure and properties of the molecule.

Given the guidelines and the need to avoid repeating previous suggestions, here are some potential actions:

1. Introduce an additional oxygen atom in a position that does not disrupt the core structure but increases polarity.
2. Replace a methyl group with an ethyl group to slightly increase the size and potentially the tPSA.
3. Add a hydroxyl group to a carbon that is not directly involved in critical bonding, thus increasing the polarity and tPSA.

Considering these points, a promising modification could be to add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the side chain, which can increase the tPSA without significantly altering the permeability or the core structure.

Here is the final suggestion based on the above reasoning:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the side chain connected to the nitrogen atom."
]
```

This suggestion aims to increase the tPSA by introducing a polar hydroxyl group while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size without drastically altering the core structure. From the previous suggestions, it appears that extending alkyl chains or adding ether groups has not sufficiently increased the tPSA. Therefore, we should consider introducing more polar functional groups such as amides, amines, or additional hydroxyl groups.

Given the current best molecule and its tPSA value, let's consider the following modification:

- Introduce an additional amide group in place of one of the existing carbon atoms in the alkyl chain. This change can potentially increase the tPSA significantly while keeping the molecule similar to the original structure.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace one of the carbon atoms in the alkyl chain connected to the oxygen atom with an amide group."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule CCNc1nc(-c2cc(Cl)cs2)nc(C)c1C(C)C, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups without drastically altering the molecular structure. The previous attempts did not significantly increase the tPSA beyond the threshold. Therefore, we should focus on adding functional groups that are known to increase polarity and thus tPSA.

Given the constraints and the need to avoid repeating previous suggestions, a viable approach would be to add an amide group or an additional hydroxyl group in a position that does not disrupt the core structure significantly. This modification can help in achieving the desired increase in tPSA while keeping the molecule similar to the original.

Here’s a detailed reasoning process:
- Adding an amide group (-CONH2) or an extra hydroxyl group (-OH) can increase the polarity of the molecule.
- These groups should be added in positions that do not alter the core scaffold too much, ensuring structural similarity.
- Avoiding previously suggested modifications like changing the terminal methyl group to other groups will ensure we explore new avenues.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add an amide group to the nitrogen atom attached to the benzothiazole ring."
]
```

This suggestion aims to increase the tPSA by introducing a polar amide group, which should help in achieving the desired properties while maintaining structural similarity with the original molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. Given the previous suggestions and their outcomes, we should explore changes that have not been previously attempted.

Here’s a reasoning process:
- The original molecule has a tPSA of 35.07.
- We need to increase this value by at least 10 units, so the target tPSA is approximately 45.07 or higher.
- Modifications should focus on adding or enlarging polar functional groups like hydroxyl, amino, or carboxyl groups, which are known to increase tPSA.
- We should avoid repeating previous suggestions and ensure that the new molecule remains structurally similar to the original.

Based on these considerations, here is a suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the carbon atom adjacent to the nitrogen in the cyclohexane ring."

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. From the previous suggestions, we observe that introducing an oxygen atom in a way that increases polarity and molecular surface area can effectively raise the tPSA.

Given the current best molecule `CC(C)CNC(=O)[C@H]1CS[C@H](C(=O)Oc2ccc(F)cc2)N1` with a tPSA of 67.43, which already shows an improvement from the root molecule's tPSA of 58.64, we should aim for further modifications that continue this trend without altering the core structure too much.

Considering these points, a viable action could be to replace a methyl group (-CH3) with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), as this introduces an additional oxygen atom, potentially increasing the tPSA further. This change maintains structural similarity while achieving the desired property enhancement.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace one of the methyl groups attached to the central carbon with a hydroxymethyl group."
]
```

This modification aims to increase the tPSA further while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the input molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. From the previous suggestions, we see that introducing oxygen (ether linkages) and sulfur (thioether linkages) has been effective in increasing tPSA.

Given the current best molecule with a tPSA of 54.94, we aim to further increase this value without repeating previous modifications. A strategic approach would be to add an additional hydroxyl group or replace an existing carbon with a nitrogen atom, which can also increase polarity and hence tPSA.

Here’s a reasoned suggestion:

- Introduce a hydroxyl group on one of the terminal carbons of the alkyl chain. This modification will increase the polarity of the molecule and thus its tPSA, while keeping the overall structure similar.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Introduce a hydroxyl group on one of the terminal carbons of the alkyl chain."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. The previous suggestions introduced oxygen and sulfur atoms in different positions, which did not significantly alter the tPSA beyond the threshold. Therefore, we should explore further modifications that can enhance polarity more effectively.

Given the constraints and previous attempts, a promising approach is to add additional hydroxyl groups or amine groups, which are known to increase tPSA. Specifically, we can target positions on the aromatic rings or on the side chains where such additions would be feasible without drastically changing the molecular structure.

Here’s a detailed reasoning process:
- Adding a hydroxyl group to an aromatic ring can increase tPSA.
- Introducing an amine group in a position that does not disrupt the core structure can also enhance tPSA.
- Ensuring that the modification does not repeat previously suggested changes will help in exploring new possibilities.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the second carbon atom of the phenyl ring attached to the thioether group."
]
```

This modification aims to increase the tPSA by introducing a polar hydroxyl group, thereby reducing permeability as required. This change is expected to be significant enough to meet the tPSA increase threshold while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size slightly without drastically changing the structure. Based on the previous suggestions and their outcomes, we can infer that simple substitutions with more polar groups might not be sufficient. We need a modification that introduces additional polar surface area effectively.

Given the constraints and the need to avoid repeating previous suggestions, one effective approach could be to add an amide group in a position that does not significantly alter the core structure but increases polarity and thus tPSA. Adding a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring can also enhance the tPSA. 

Let's consider these points and formulate a new suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring attached to the amide group."
]
```

This suggestion aims to increase the tPSA by introducing a hydroxyl group, which is known for its significant contribution to the polar surface area, thereby potentially achieving the desired increase in tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups without drastically changing the molecular structure. The previous attempts have not significantly altered the tPSA value from the root molecule's 53.77. Therefore, more substantial changes are needed.

Given that replacing the fluorine with chlorine did not change the tPSA, we should consider adding or replacing functional groups that can more effectively increase the tPSA. Introducing hydroxyl groups or amine groups could be effective as they are known to increase polarity and hence tPSA. Additionally, we should avoid repeating the previous suggestions like replacing the fluorine with chlorine, bromine, or other simple substitutions.

Based on these considerations, here is a suggestion:

- Add a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring of the original molecule.

This modification should help in increasing the tPSA sufficiently while keeping the molecule structurally similar.

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring of the original molecule."
]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups without drastically changing the molecular structure. The previous attempts did not meet the tPSA increase requirement, so we need to explore more effective changes.

Given that adding a hydroxyl group or other simple polar groups did not sufficiently increase the tPSA, we should consider introducing more complex polar functionalities such as amino groups, carboxylates, or sulfonates, which can significantly enhance polarity and thus tPSA.

Here is the reasoning process:
- The original molecule has a tPSA of 90.49.
- Previous modifications like adding an oxygen atom (ether linkage) resulted in a tPSA decrease or insufficient increase.
- We need a modification that increases the tPSA more effectively, possibly by adding more polar groups or increasing the size of existing polar groups.

Based on this, a promising approach would be to add an amino group to the benzene ring or another part of the molecule where it does not disrupt the overall structure significantly.

Final suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add an amino group to the phenyl ring of the original molecule."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. The previous suggestions have already explored some changes, such as altering the nitroso group and adding oxygen atoms to nitrogen. We should now explore further modifications that can significantly increase the tPSA without drastically changing the molecular structure.

Given that the original molecule has a tPSA of 59.75 and we aim for an increase of more than 10 units, we need to focus on functional groups that can contribute significantly to this property. Adding hydroxyl groups or extending existing polar groups could be effective strategies.

Here is a reasoned suggestion:

- Introduce a hydroxyl group on one of the carbon atoms in the cyclohexane ring to increase polarity and tPSA. This modification will add a significant polar surface area without altering the core structure too much.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the cyclohexane ring adjacent to the amino group."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. This can be done by adding oxygen-containing groups like hydroxyl or ether functionalities, which are known to increase tPSA and decrease permeability.

Given the previous suggestions, we should avoid repeating those changes and look for new opportunities within the molecule. One effective approach could be to add an additional hydroxyl group to the benzene ring or modify the amide group to a more polar structure. Another possibility is to add a small polar group to the terminal nitrogen of the nitrile group.

Let's consider these options:

- Adding a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring.
- Modifying the amide group to an amine with an additional hydroxyl group.
- Introducing a polar group near the nitrile nitrogen.

Based on this reasoning, here is a suggestion that adheres to the guidelines and aims to increase tPSA significantly:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring."
]
```

This modification introduces an additional polar group, which should help in increasing the tPSA and lowering permeability while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To increase the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to introduce polar groups that can increase the polar surface area without drastically altering the structure. Given that the previous modifications did not achieve the desired increase in tPSA, we should consider adding more polar functionalities or extending existing ones.

Let's analyze the previous attempts:
- Adding an extra carbon chain (OCC) did not change the tPSA.
- Introducing a sulfur atom (SC) also did not alter the tPSA significantly.

Considering these points, let's try introducing additional oxygen atoms or nitrogen atoms in positions that can enhance polarity and thus increase the tPSA. We should focus on areas where such additions will not disrupt the overall structure too much but will still have a significant impact.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the hydroxyl group attached to the benzene ring with a carboxyl group."
]
```

This modification introduces an additional oxygen atom in a form of a carboxyl group, which is expected to increase the tPSA more effectively compared to the previous attempts.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to consider modifications that can significantly increase the polar surface area without drastically altering the molecular structure. Based on the previous attempts and their outcomes, we can infer that replacing or adding polar groups such as carboxyl groups or other polar functionalities might help in achieving the desired increase in tPSA.

Given that the replacement of the hydroxyl group with a carboxyl group in the previous attempt resulted in an increase in tPSA but did not fully meet the target, we should explore further modifications around this strategy. Specifically, we can try adding additional polar groups or modifying existing ones to enhance the polar surface area further.

Here is the reasoning for the final suggestion:
- We have already tried replacing the hydroxyl group attached to the benzene ring with a carboxyl group, which increased the tPSA from 54.46 to 62.30.
- To further increase the tPSA, we can add another polar group to the molecule. A suitable modification could be adding an additional hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring or extending the chain with a polar group.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add an additional hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring that already contains the carboxyl group."
]
```

This modification aims to increase the polarity and thus the tPSA of the molecule while keeping it structurally similar to the original compound.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing functional groups. Given that the previous attempts did not meet the tPSA threshold, we should consider more substantial changes that can effectively increase the tPSA without drastically altering the molecular structure.

The original molecule has a tPSA of 81.42, and we need to increase this value by at least 10 units. The previous candidate had a lower tPSA of 67.43, indicating that the modifications did not achieve the desired effect. Therefore, we should explore adding more polar groups such as hydroxyls, amines, or ethers, which are known to increase tPSA.

Considering these points, here is a reasoned suggestion:

- Add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring to increase polarity and tPSA while keeping the molecule similar to the original.

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring that does not already have a substituent."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To increase the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to introduce polar groups that can enhance the polarity and thus the tPSA without drastically changing the molecular structure. The previous attempts did not alter the tPSA significantly because they mostly extended the carbon chain, which does not effectively increase polarity.

Given this, we should consider adding or replacing functional groups with more polar ones, such as amides, ethers, or hydroxyl groups. Since we need to avoid repeating previous suggestions, we can explore modifications like adding an additional oxygen atom in a form of a hydroxyl group or ether linkage, which can increase the tPSA without altering the core structure too much.

Here’s a reasoned suggestion:

- Add a hydroxyl group to one of the existing carbon atoms in the alkyl chain to increase the polarity and hence the tPSA. This modification introduces a new polar group that is likely to increase the tPSA value sufficiently while keeping the molecule similar to the original.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the alkyl chain next to the ester group."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To increase the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to introduce polar groups that can increase the polarity and thus the tPSA of the molecule. Given the previous attempts did not change the tPSA from the root molecule, we should consider adding functional groups that are known to significantly increase the tPSA, such as additional hydroxyl groups or amine groups.

Let's consider the following modifications:
- Adding a hydroxyl group to an existing carbon.
- Replacing a methyl group with a hydroxymethyl group.
- Introducing an amine group to replace a hydrogen on a carbon.

Taking these into account and ensuring we do not repeat previous suggestions, here is a modification instruction:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group in the original molecule."
]
```

This modification aims to increase the polarity and hence the tPSA without drastically changing the structure of the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. From the previous attempts, we see that introducing oxygen atoms (like in ethers or hydroxyl groups) and sulfur atoms has been effective in increasing the tPSA.

Given the current best molecule `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(CNC(=O)[C@H]2CCCO[NH+](C)C2)o1` with a tPSA of 82.21, which is already above the threshold of 82.98 (72.98 + 10), we should explore further modifications that can increase the tPSA without drastically changing the structure.

Let's consider adding an additional hydroxyl group or replacing a methyl group with a hydroxymethyl group, as these changes are likely to increase the tPSA while maintaining structural similarity.

Here’s the final suggestion based on the guidelines:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace one of the methyl groups attached to nitrogen with a hydroxymethyl group."
]
```

This modification should help in increasing the tPSA further while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. The previous attempts have not achieved the desired tPSA increase, so we should explore different functional group additions or replacements that can enhance polarity without drastically changing the molecular structure.

Given the current best molecule from the previous suggestions:
- Cc1cc(C)c(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccc(OCC)c3ccccc23)c(C)c1 with a tPSA of 55.4

We aim to increase the tPSA further. One effective way is to replace or add more polar groups like hydroxyl groups, amine groups, or ethers, which are known to increase tPSA. Considering the guidelines and avoiding repetition, here is a potential modification:

- Replace the methyl group (C) attached to the benzene ring with an amino group (NH2), which will introduce additional polarity and hydrogen bonding capability, thus potentially increasing the tPSA.

Here is the final suggestion based on this reasoning:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the methyl group attached to the benzene ring with an amino group."
]
```

This change should help in achieving the desired increase in tPSA while keeping the molecule similar to the original structure.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. From the previous suggestions, we can see that some attempts did not change the tPSA as intended. Therefore, we should focus on adding or enlarging polar functional groups like hydroxyl, amine, or carboxyl groups, which are known to increase tPSA.

Given the constraints and the need to avoid repeating previous suggestions, here is a thoughtful modification:

- Adding a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring can increase the polarity and thus the tPSA without drastically changing the structure. This modification aims to enhance the molecule's polarity and lower permeability.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. From the previous suggestions, we observe that adding oxygen atoms (hydroxyl groups) effectively increases tPSA. However, we should avoid repeating the exact changes already suggested.

Given that the current best molecule has a tPSA of 54.26, which is an improvement over the original 46.92, we can explore further modifications that introduce additional polar groups or increase the size of existing ones. For instance, replacing bromine with a larger and more polar group could be effective. Alternatively, introducing another hydroxyl group in a different position could also help.

Here's a reasoned suggestion based on these considerations:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the bromine atom with a sulfonic acid group on the benzene ring."
]
```

This modification introduces a highly polar group (sulfonic acid) that significantly increases tPSA while keeping the overall structure similar to the original molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size without drastically altering the core structure. The previous attempts have not sufficiently increased the tPSA, so we should explore other polar functional groups that can contribute to a higher tPSA.

Given that adding an ether group (OCC) slightly decreased the tPSA from the root molecule, and adding more complex ethers or esters did not meet the threshold, we should try introducing different types of polar groups such as amines, amides, or sulfonamides, which are known to increase tPSA effectively.

Let's consider replacing the amide group with a sulfonamide group, which is a common strategy in medicinal chemistry to increase polarity and water solubility, thereby potentially increasing tPSA.

Here’s a possible modification:

- Replace the amide nitrogen (N) attached to the carbonyl (C=O) with a sulfonamide group (N(S(=O)(=O))).

This change aims to significantly increase the tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the amide nitrogen attached to the carbonyl with a sulfonamide group."
]
```

This suggestion avoids repeating previous suggestions and focuses on a modification that could achieve the desired increase in tPSA.

AI Suggestion 0: To increase the tPSA by at least 10 while lowering permeability and maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size without drastically changing the structure. Based on the previous suggestions and their properties, we can infer that simply changing chirality or substituting a chlorine with a hydroxyl group did not significantly alter the tPSA as desired. Therefore, we should focus on adding more polarizable or larger functional groups that can effectively increase the tPSA.

Here’s a reasoning process:
1. **Addition of Polar Groups**: Introducing additional polar groups such as amine, hydroxyl, or carboxyl can increase tPSA.
2. **Increase Molecular Size**: Adding side chains or rings can reduce permeability and potentially increase tPSA.
3. **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure that the new suggestion does not repeat any changes already explored in previous suggestions.

Given these considerations, one effective modification could be to add a hydroxyl group to an existing aromatic ring, which would increase the polarity and size of the molecule without altering its core structure significantly.

### final_suggestion
```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring attached to the chlorine atom."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule Nc1nc(Cc2nc3ccc(Br)cc3s2)cs1, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size without drastically altering the structure. The previous attempts did not achieve the desired increase in tPSA, so we should explore different functional group additions or replacements.

Given that adding a fluorine did not change the tPSA, we can infer that simply replacing the bromine with other halogens or small groups might not be sufficient. Instead, we should consider introducing more polarizable or larger groups that can significantly impact the tPSA.

Let's focus on modifying the benzene ring where the bromine is attached. Introducing an additional oxygen atom as part of a hydroxyl group or an ether linkage could potentially increase the tPSA sufficiently. Another approach could be to add an amine group, which is also known to increase tPSA.

Based on these considerations, here is a suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the bromine atom on the benzene ring with a hydroxyl group."
]
```

This modification introduces a polar hydroxyl group, which should increase the tPSA and reduce permeability, aligning with the objectives outlined in the root question.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of lowering permeability and increasing tPSA by at least 10, we need to consider modifications that introduce more polar groups or increase the molecular size without drastically changing the structure. Given that the previous suggestions did not change the tPSA from the root molecule, we need to explore different modifications that could potentially increase tPSA.

Let's analyze the options:

1. **Adding Polar Groups**: Introducing hydroxyl, amino, or sulfonic acid groups can increase tPSA.
2. **Increasing Molecular Size**: Adding a small alkyl chain or another aromatic ring can also help in increasing tPSA while reducing permeability.
3. **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure that the new suggestion does not repeat the previous ones, especially those that did not change the tPSA.

Given these considerations, a promising modification could be adding a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring attached to the sulfur atom. This will increase the polarity and thus the tPSA, while maintaining structural similarity.

Here is the final suggestion following the guidelines:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the phenyl ring attached to the sulfur atom."
]
```

This modification aims to increase the tPSA and reduce permeability by introducing a polar hydroxyl group, which should have a significant impact compared to the previous attempts.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule CCS(=O)(=O)N[C@@H](c1ccccc1)[C@@H](C)C(=O)OC, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups without drastically changing the molecular structure. The previous attempts have not significantly altered the tPSA beyond the threshold, so we should explore more effective changes.

Given the root molecule and the requirement to increase tPSA, adding polar functional groups such as additional hydroxyl or amino groups can help. However, we must ensure these changes do not overly disrupt the original structure's integrity and permeability properties.

Considering the guidelines and the need for a new approach, here is a reasoned suggestion:

- Adding a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring could introduce polarity without significantly altering the core structure. This change can potentially increase the tPSA effectively while keeping the molecule similar to the original.

Based on this reasoning, the final suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring of the molecule."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. The previous suggestions have shown some success in increasing tPSA by adding oxygen atoms (which contribute to higher tPSA due to their polarity).

Given that the current best molecule has a tPSA of 74.25 and we aim for an increase from the original 66.91 by at least 10, our target tPSA should be around 76.91 or higher. The previous modifications introduced hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, which are effective in increasing tPSA.

Let's consider further modifications that can enhance tPSA without drastically changing the structure:

1. Adding another hydroxyl group to the benzene ring.
2. Introducing an additional amide linkage with a hydroxyl-containing side chain.
3. Replacing a methyl group with a methoxy group to add more polarity.
4. Extending the chain length of existing polar groups.

Based on these considerations, here is a modification instruction that follows the guidelines and aims to meet the criteria:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace one of the carbon atoms in the benzene ring attached to the nitrogen with an oxygen atom to form an ether linkage."
]
```

This suggestion introduces an additional oxygen atom in a way that maintains structural similarity and potentially increases tPSA further.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. From the previous suggestions, we see that adding oxygen atoms in various positions (like hydroxyl or ether groups) has been effective in increasing tPSA.

Given the current best molecule `C=C(C)C[C@@H](O)c1ncccc1O` with a tPSA of 53.35, which is already an improvement over the original 46.01, we should aim for further modifications that continue this trend without drastically altering the structure.

Here’s a step-by-step reasoning process:
1. The addition of an oxygen atom as a hydroxyl group has increased tPSA.
2. Adding another oxygen atom, possibly as another hydroxyl group or as part of an amide or sulfonamide group, could further increase tPSA.
3. To maintain similarity, the new functional group should be added to a position that does not significantly change the core structure of the molecule.

Based on these considerations, here is a suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring at the meta position relative to the existing hydroxyl group."
]
```

This suggestion introduces an additional hydroxyl group to the benzene ring, which should increase the tPSA further while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on adding polar functional groups that can increase the tPSA without drastically changing the molecular structure. Based on the previous attempts and their outcomes, it seems that adding a hydroxyl group in strategic positions can be effective. However, since the addition of a hydroxyl group at the meta position relative to the existing hydroxyl group did not significantly improve the tPSA beyond the required threshold, we should consider other modifications.

Given that the current best molecule is C=C(C)C[C@@H](O)c1ncccn1, let's explore the possibility of adding an additional hydroxyl group or another polar group like an amine to further increase the tPSA. Specifically, we can add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring at a different position or introduce an amine group to enhance polarity.

Here’s the reasoning process:
- Adding a hydroxyl group to the ortho position relative to the existing hydroxyl group might create steric hindrance but could also increase tPSA.
- Introducing an amine group instead of a hydroxyl group could also increase the tPSA effectively while maintaining structural similarity.

Based on this, the final suggestion would be:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring at the ortho position relative to the existing hydroxyl group."
]
```

This modification aims to increase the tPSA by introducing an additional polar group in a position that has not been previously explored, thereby potentially achieving the desired increase in tPSA while keeping the molecule similar to the input.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to introduce functional groups that increase the polarity and molecular surface area without drastically altering the structure. Based on the previous suggestions and their outcomes, we should focus on adding polar groups or extending existing chains in a way that increases tPSA.

Given that the previous attempts did not change the tPSA significantly, we need more substantial modifications. Adding an additional oxygen atom in a form of a hydroxyl group or an ether linkage can help increase the tPSA. Additionally, introducing an amide or carboxyl group could also enhance the polarity and thus the tPSA.

Let's consider modifying the benzene ring or the alkyl chains connected to it. Specifically, adding a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the alkyl chain or substituting a methylene group with an oxygen atom (forming an ether) can be effective.

Here’s a reasoned suggestion:

- Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the alkyl chain that is attached to the benzene ring. This modification will increase the polarity and surface area, contributing to a higher tPSA.

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the second carbon atom of the alkyl chain attached to the nitrogen atom in the amide group."
]
```

This approach aims to increase the tPSA while keeping the overall structure similar to the original molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups without drastically changing the molecular framework. The previous attempts have shown some success in increasing tPSA, particularly with the introduction of oxygen and nitrogen atoms.

Given that the current best molecule has a tPSA of 101.29, which is already above the threshold when compared to the root molecule's tPSA of 98.33, we should aim for further increases while ensuring the molecule remains similar. We can explore adding additional hydroxyl or amino groups, which are known to increase tPSA and decrease permeability due to their hydrogen bonding capabilities.

Here’s a thoughtful modification:

- Introduce an additional hydroxyl group on the benzene ring to enhance polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, thus likely increasing tPSA and reducing permeability.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms on the benzene ring that does not already have a substituent."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To increase the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we can consider adding polar groups or increasing the size of existing polar groups. From the previous attempts, we observe that introducing oxygen atoms (hydroxyl groups) and sulfur atoms has been effective in increasing tPSA. However, we need to avoid repeating the exact modifications already suggested.

Given the need to increase tPSA further and ensure the molecule remains similar to the original, a strategic approach would be to add an additional hydroxyl group to a different part of the molecule, specifically on a carbon atom that hasn't been modified yet. This should help in increasing the tPSA without drastically changing the molecular structure.

Here is the reasoning process followed by the final suggestion:

1. The original molecule has a tPSA of 46.92.
2. Previous modifications have successfully increased tPSA but not enough to meet the threshold for all candidates.
3. Adding a hydroxyl group to a new position can increase tPSA while keeping the molecule similar.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring at a position that currently has a hydrogen atom, ensuring it does not repeat the positions previously modified."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 while lowering permeability and maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size without drastically changing the core structure. The previous attempts introduced oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and benzene rings, but did not significantly increase the tPSA as required.

Given that the introduction of an oxygen atom in one of the previous suggestions (C[C@@H](Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl)C(=O)N1CCN(S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(O)cc2)CC1) resulted in a lower tPSA (77.92) compared to the root molecule (100.83), we should consider more substantial changes that can effectively increase the polarity and molecular surface area.

One effective strategy could be to add additional hydroxyl groups or amine groups, which are known to increase tPSA and decrease permeability due to their hydrogen bonding capabilities. However, we must ensure these additions do not overly disrupt the structural similarity to the original molecule.

Considering the guidelines and the need for a new approach:

- Adding a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring might help increase tPSA without altering the core structure too much.
- Introducing a secondary amine group could also be beneficial.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms on the phenyl ring attached to the chiral center."
]
```

This modification aims to increase the tPSA and reduce permeability while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size without drastically altering the core structure. Based on the previous suggestions and their outcomes, we can infer that simply extending alkyl chains or adding small polar groups may not significantly change the tPSA.

Given that the tPSA needs to be increased by more than 10 units, we should focus on introducing larger polar functional groups that can effectively increase the tPSA. However, we must ensure that these changes do not overly compromise the structural similarity to the original molecule.

Considering the guidelines and the need for a significant increase in tPSA, one effective approach is to replace a methyl group with a more polar and larger substituent such as an amino group or a hydroxymethyl group. This modification can potentially increase the tPSA without drastically changing the overall structure.

Here is the final suggestion based on the above reasoning:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the methyl group attached to the nitrogen atom in the piperidine ring with an amino group."
]
```

This modification introduces a polar group that can increase the tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we can consider adding polar functional groups that will increase the polarity and thus the tPSA without drastically changing the structure. Based on the previous suggestions and their outcomes, we should avoid repeating modifications that have already been suggested. 

Given that the current best molecule has a tPSA of 83.82, which is an improvement from the original 74.59, we need to further increase this value. One effective way to do this is by adding more hydroxyl groups or other polar groups like amino groups, which are known to increase tPSA.

Let's consider the following modification:

- Adding a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring to increase polarity and tPSA while keeping the overall structure similar.

This change should help in achieving the desired increase in tPSA without significantly altering the permeability properties.

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms on the phenyl ring adjacent to the amide group."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size in a way that enhances the polarity without drastically changing the structure. The previous attempts have not met the tPSA threshold, so we should consider more significant changes that involve adding functional groups known to increase tPSA.

Given the original molecule `CC(C)CC[C@H](C)NC(=O)CN1C[C@@H](C)C[C@H]([NH3+])C1` with a tPSA of 59.98, and aiming for a tPSA of at least 70, we can consider adding hydroxyl groups or other polar groups like amino groups, which are known to increase tPSA significantly.

Here's a reasoned modification:

- Add a hydroxyl group to one of the methyl groups attached to the central carbon chain. This will increase the polarity and thus the tPSA, while keeping the overall structure similar.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the methyl groups attached to the central carbon chain."
]
```

This modification should help in achieving the desired increase in tPSA while ensuring the molecule remains structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing functional groups. Given that the previous attempts did not change the tPSA as intended, we should consider more significant changes, such as adding additional polar functionalities like amine or hydroxyl groups, which can increase tPSA without drastically altering the molecular structure.

Let's consider the following reasoning:
- Adding a hydroxyl group (-OH) or an amine group (-NH2) can increase the polarity and thus the tPSA.
- We should avoid repeating the previous suggestions and ensure that the new suggestion introduces a meaningful change in tPSA.
- The modification should be minimal yet effective to keep the molecule similar to the original.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the alkyl chain attached to the amide group."
]
```

This suggestion aims to introduce a hydroxyl group, which is expected to increase the tPSA and lower permeability, while keeping the overall structure similar to the original molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups without drastically altering the molecular structure. From the previous suggestions, we observe that adding oxygen (hydroxyl or ether groups) and sulfur (thiol or sulfoxide groups) can increase the tPSA effectively. We should avoid repeating the exact changes made in the previous suggestions.

Given the current best molecule `Cc1nsnc1COc1cccc(C(=O)NCCc2ccc(O)cc2)c1` with a tPSA of 84.34, which already has an oxygen atom introduced in the phenyl ring, we can explore other positions for introducing additional polar groups. A strategic approach would be to add another hydroxyl group in a different position or introduce an amine group, which can also increase tPSA significantly.

Let's consider the following modification:

- Introduce a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring attached to the amide group, specifically at the meta position relative to the existing substituent. This change will increase polarity and thus tPSA, while maintaining structural similarity.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Introduce a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring attached to the amide group, specifically at the meta position relative to the existing substituent."
]
```

This modification aims to further increase the tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original one.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of lowering permeability and increasing tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size slightly. Based on the previous suggestions and properties, we can infer that adding functional groups like amine, hydroxyl, or additional nitrogen-containing groups has been effective in increasing tPSA.

Given that the last successful modification involved replacing an oxygen atom with a nitrogen atom (resulting in an increase from 63.24 to 72.19), we should explore further modifications that could enhance polarity without drastically changing the structure.

Here are the considerations for new modifications:
- Adding another hydroxyl group to increase polarity.
- Introducing an additional amine group.
- Replacing a methyl group with a more polar group.

Considering these points, here is a final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace one of the methyl groups adjacent to the sulfur atom with a hydroxyl group."
]
```

This modification aims to increase the polarity of the molecule, thereby potentially lowering permeability and increasing tPSA, while keeping the overall structure similar to the original molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups without drastically altering the structure. The previous attempts have shown that replacing a methyl group adjacent to the sulfur atom with a hydroxyl group can increase the tPSA but not sufficiently. We need to consider more polar substitutions or additional modifications.

Given that the current best molecule is CC(C)CC1(CNC(=O)c2ccccc2S(C)(=O)=O)CCCC1 and we need to increase the tPSA further, let's explore adding an amine group (amine groups are known to increase tPSA due to their polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities) to the structure in a way that it does not significantly affect the overall permeability and keeps the molecule similar.

Here is the reasoning process:
- Adding an amine group can increase tPSA.
- Placement should be strategic to avoid disrupting the core structure significantly.
- Avoid repeating previous modifications like simple hydroxyl group substitution.

Based on this, the final suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace one of the methyl groups adjacent to the sulfur atom with an amine group."
]
```

This modification aims to increase the tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing functional groups. Based on the previous attempts, simply changing the halogen from bromine to chlorine did not alter the tPSA. Therefore, we should focus on introducing more polarizable or larger functional groups that can significantly impact the tPSA without drastically changing the molecular structure.

Given the guidelines and the need to avoid repeating previous suggestions, here are some potential modifications:

- Introducing an additional oxygen atom in a form of a hydroxyl group to one of the aromatic carbons.
- Replacing the bromine with a larger and more polarizable group like nitro (-NO2).
- Adding an amide group to the benzene ring opposite the bromine.
- Substituting the fluorine with a methoxy group (-OCH3) to increase polarity.
- Incorporating a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) into the structure.

Considering these options and ensuring the modification is significant enough to increase the tPSA by at least 10, the following suggestion seems most appropriate:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the bromine atom with a nitro group on the same carbon."
]
```

This modification introduces a strongly electron-withdrawing and polar group, which should significantly increase the tPSA while keeping the overall structure similar to the original molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. Given the previous attempts did not significantly alter the tPSA, we should focus on more substantial changes that introduce additional polar surface area without drastically changing the molecule's structure.

Here are the reasoning steps:
1. The original molecule has a tPSA of 46.76.
2. Previous modifications did not significantly change the tPSA, indicating that minor changes might not be sufficient.
3. We need to introduce larger polar groups or multiple smaller polar groups to ensure a significant increase in tPSA.
4. Maintaining the core structure is important to keep the molecules similar.

Based on this reasoning, here is a suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the nitrogen atom in the amine group connected to the cyclohexane ring with an amino acid side chain such as glycine, which introduces an additional carboxyl group and increases the polarity."
]
```

This modification should help in achieving a higher tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size without drastically changing the core structure. Based on the previous suggestions and their outcomes, we can infer that adding ether or amine functionalities increases tPSA effectively.

Given that the previous best candidate Cn1cc(Br)c(C(=O)N/N=C/c2ccc(OCC)cc2O)n1 has a tPSA of 88.74, which is an improvement from the root molecule's tPSA of 79.51, we should aim for further modifications that can push the tPSA higher without repeating previous changes.

Considering these points, one effective approach could be to add another oxygen-containing group or nitrogen-containing group in a position that does not alter the core structure significantly but contributes to the polar surface area.

Here’s a reasoned suggestion:

- Introduce an additional hydroxyl group attached to the benzene ring that already contains chlorine, ensuring this modification maintains structural similarity and potentially increases tPSA further.

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the carbon adjacent to the chlorine atom on the benzene ring."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups without drastically changing the molecular structure. From the previous attempts, it's clear that simply adding a hydroxyl group adjacent to the chlorine atom did not significantly alter the tPSA as required. Therefore, we should explore other positions or additional modifications.

Given that the current best molecule is `Cn1cc(Br)c(C(=O)N/N=C/c2cc(Cl)ccc2O)n1` and its tPSA is 79.51, we aim to increase this value by more than 10. Adding a hydroxyl group has been tried, so we should consider adding an amino group or extending the chain with an ether linkage to increase polarity and thus tPSA.

Let's consider adding an amino group to the benzene ring in a position that hasn't been modified yet, specifically on the carbon opposite to the chlorine atom. This change can potentially increase the tPSA sufficiently while keeping the molecule similar to the original.

Here’s the reasoning process:
- The modification should introduce a new polar group to increase tPSA.
- The modification should be in a different position from previously attempted changes to avoid repetition.
- The molecule should remain structurally similar to the original.

Based on this, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add an amino group to the carbon opposite to the chlorine atom on the benzene ring."
]
```

This suggestion aims to increase the tPSA by introducing a new polar group in a strategic position on the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while lowering permeability and maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to introduce polar groups that can increase the tPSA without drastically altering the structure. From the previous suggestions, it appears that extending the chain or adding polar groups like hydroxyl, thiol, amino, or carboxyl groups on the aromatic ring or side chains could be effective. However, we should avoid repeating the exact changes made in the previous suggestions.

Given these considerations, a promising approach would be to add an additional polar group to the existing structure, specifically targeting positions that have not been modified yet. For instance, adding a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring or modifying the amide group can enhance polarity and increase tPSA.

Here is a suggestion based on this reasoning:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring adjacent to the nitrogen atom attached to the quaternary ammonium center."
]
```

This modification introduces a new polar group, which should increase the tPSA and decrease permeability, while keeping the overall structure similar to the original molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size slightly without drastically changing the structure. Given that previous attempts did not alter the tPSA, we should consider more significant but still subtle changes, such as adding a hydroxyl group or an amine group to the molecule.

Here’s a step-by-step reasoning process:
1. The original molecule has a tPSA of 55.12.
2. Previous modifications did not change the tPSA, indicating that the changes were too minor.
3. We need to introduce functional groups that can significantly increase the tPSA.
4. Adding a hydroxyl group or an amine group can increase polarity and thus tPSA.
5. Ensure that the added group does not disrupt the overall structure too much to maintain similarity.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to one of the carbon atoms in the phenyl ring that currently has two fluorine substituents."
]
```

This modification introduces a polar hydroxyl group, which should increase the tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. From the previous suggestions, we see that adding or modifying functional groups such as carboxylates and hydroxyls has been effective in increasing tPSA. We should avoid repeating these exact changes but can use similar strategies.

Given the root molecule and its tPSA of 47.95, and considering the previous candidate with a tPSA of 57.61, which already meets the threshold, we can explore other modifications that could further increase tPSA without drastically changing the molecular structure.

Let's consider adding an additional amine group or replacing an existing methyl group with a more polar group like an amide or alcohol. This will help in increasing the polarity and thus the tPSA.

Here is the reasoning process leading to the final suggestion:

- Adding an amine group to a non-polar part of the molecule can increase tPSA.
- Replacing a methyl group with an amide or alcohol can also increase tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar.

Based on this, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace one of the methyl groups attached to the central carbon with an amide group by adding a carbonyl group followed by an amine group."
]
```

This modification should help in achieving the desired increase in tPSA while ensuring the molecule remains similar to the original structure.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the molecular size slightly without drastically changing the core structure. Based on the previous suggestions and their properties, it seems that simply extending the chain with alkyl groups did not significantly alter the tPSA. Therefore, we should consider adding more polar functionalities that can effectively increase the tPSA.

Here is a reasoning process:
1. The original molecule has a tPSA of 76.91.
2. We need to increase this value by at least 10 units.
3. Previous attempts involved adding alkyl chains which did not significantly change the tPSA.
4. Adding polar groups such as hydroxyl, amino, or carboxyl groups can increase the tPSA more effectively.

Based on this, a new suggestion would be to add a hydroxyl group to the existing structure, which will likely increase the tPSA without altering the core structure too much.

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the carbon atom adjacent to the nitrogen in the amide group."
]
```

This modification should help in achieving the desired increase in tPSA while keeping the molecule similar to the original structure.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups, which can increase the tPSA without drastically altering the structure. Based on previous attempts, simply adding a hydroxyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen in the amide group did not sufficiently increase the tPSA. We should consider adding more polar groups or extending the existing ones.

Given that the current best molecule is `C[C@H]1C[NH+]2CCCC[C@@H]2CN1C(=O)NC[C@@H](C)C(=O)[O-]` and its tPSA is 76.91, we need to aim for a tPSA of at least 86.91. Adding functional groups such as additional hydroxyl groups or other polar groups like amines or ethers can help achieve this.

Let's analyze the previous suggestions:
- Adding a hydroxyl group to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen in the amide group did not meet the tPSA increase requirement.
- Extending chains with additional oxygen atoms (like ethers) slightly increased tPSA but not enough.

Based on these observations, a viable approach could be to add another hydroxyl group to an existing carbon atom that is not directly involved in critical interactions, ensuring the molecule remains similar to the original.

### Reasoning Process:
1. Identify a carbon atom that can accommodate an additional hydroxyl group without significantly changing the overall structure.
2. Ensure the modification increases the polarity sufficiently to raise the tPSA by more than 10 units.

### Final Suggestion:
Add a hydroxyl group to the carbon atom that is part of the cyclohexane ring but not directly attached to the nitrogen or oxygen atoms already present in the amide group.

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the carbon atom in the cyclohexane ring that is two positions away from the nitrogen in the amide group."
]
```

This suggestion aims to increase the polarity of the molecule by introducing an additional hydroxyl group, thereby potentially increasing the tPSA beyond the required threshold while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule and not repeating previous suggestions, we can consider adding polar functional groups that will increase the tPSA without drastically altering the structure. The previous modifications introduced hydroxyl, thiol, amino, fluoro, and chloro groups. To further increase the tPSA, we can introduce additional polar groups or larger ones like a carboxylic acid group, which is not previously used.

Given the need to increase tPSA and reduce permeability, introducing a carboxylic acid group could be beneficial as it increases polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, thus lowering permeability and increasing tPSA.

Here's the reasoning process:
- The original molecule has a tPSA of 74.5.
- The target is to increase tPSA by more than 10, so the new tPSA should be greater than 84.5.
- Previous modifications have already achieved a tPSA of 81.59 with the addition of a hydroxyl group.
- Adding a carboxylic acid group can significantly increase the tPSA due to its high polarity and hydrogen bonding capability.

Based on this, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace one of the methyl groups adjacent to the carbonyl group with a carboxylic acid group."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. The previous attempts did not change the tPSA from the root molecule, indicating that the modifications were not sufficient or effective in altering the tPSA.

Given the constraints and the need to avoid repeating previous suggestions, a viable approach would be to modify the sulfur-containing group or add additional polar groups in positions that do not drastically alter the structure's core framework. Specifically, adding an amine group or hydroxyl group can effectively increase the tPSA without significantly changing the overall structure.

Here’s a step-by-step reasoning process:

1. **Identify Key Modification Sites**: Focus on areas that have not been previously modified, such as the sulfur-containing thioether group.
2. **Introduce Polar Groups**: Adding a hydroxyl group or an amine group can increase the tPSA.
3. **Maintain Similarity**: Ensure that the changes are minimal and localized to maintain structural similarity.

Based on this reasoning, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the sulfur atom in the thioether group with an oxygen atom to form an ether group."
]
```

This modification introduces a more polar oxygen atom instead of sulfur, which should help in increasing the tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups or increase the size of existing polar groups. From the previous attempts, we learned that replacing the sulfur atom in the thioether group with an oxygen atom was a step in the right direction, as it increased the tPSA from 76.63 to 85.86. However, further increases are needed.

Given this information, we can try to add additional polar groups or extend existing ones without drastically changing the molecule's structure. One effective way to do this is by adding more ether groups or extending the alkyl chains attached to the ether groups, which can increase the tPSA without significantly altering the overall structure.

Based on these considerations, here is the suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace one of the methyl groups attached to the phenyl ring with an ethoxy group."
]
```

This modification introduces an additional ether group, which should help in increasing the tPSA further while keeping the molecule similar to the original structure.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that introduce polar groups without drastically altering the structure. The previous suggestions have introduced hydroxyl groups and other polar functionalities, which have slightly affected the tPSA but not sufficiently increased it. We should aim for more significant polar additions while ensuring the molecule remains similar.

Given the root molecule CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)[O-] with a tPSA of 88.84, and considering the previous attempts did not meet the tPSA increase threshold, we can try introducing an additional amide group or a secondary amine, which are known to increase tPSA and decrease permeability effectively.

Here’s the reasoning process:
- Introducing an additional amide group could increase polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity.
- Adding a secondary amine in a position that does not disrupt the core structure can also enhance the tPSA.
- Ensuring these changes do not repeat previous modifications and maintain structural similarity is crucial.

Based on this, here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add an amide group to the benzene ring at the meta position relative to the existing amide group."
]
```

This modification introduces a new polar group that should significantly increase the tPSA while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of increasing the tPSA by at least 10 units while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that introduce polar groups without drastically changing the structure. The previous attempts have shown that adding an amide group did not significantly increase the tPSA as desired. Therefore, we should explore other polar functional groups such as hydroxyl or additional amine groups, which can increase the tPSA more effectively.

Given that the current best molecule is CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)[O-] and its tPSA is 88.84, we aim to modify this molecule in a way that introduces more polar surface area. One effective approach could be to add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring, which has been shown in previous attempts to increase tPSA but needs to be placed strategically to maximize the effect.

Based on the guidelines and previous experiences, the following modification seems promising:

Add a hydroxyl group to the meta position relative to the existing cyano group on the benzene ring.

This modification will introduce a polar group that increases the tPSA and lowers permeability, aligning with the objective.

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Add a hydroxyl group to the meta position relative to the existing cyano group on the benzene ring."
]
```

This suggestion adheres to the guidelines by providing a clear modification instruction, ensuring similarity to the original molecule, and avoiding repetition of previous suggestions.

'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "\n    $root_question: Can you make molecule Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)no1 lower permeability and increase tPSA by at least 10. ? The output molecule should be similar to the input molecule.  Give me five molecules in SMILES only and list them using bullet points. No explanation is needed. \n\n    $root_property: The tPSA of root molecule is: 55.13. \n\n    $threshold: You should optimize the tPSA increase more than the amount of 10. \n\n    \n    Consider the $root_prompt, $root_property, $threshold. Your task is to suggest possible actions that could achieve the intent of the $root_question.\n\n    $search_state: current_best_mol in the message\n\n    $action_space: Add, delete, replace an atom or functional group.\n\n    Your answers should use the following guidelines:\n0) 1. You should give a python list named final_suggestion which contains top-1 suggestion based on the previous information.\n2. You should learn from the previous experience, especially the substructure change of molecules.\n3. Your suggestion should not repeat the previous suggestion in $previous prompt.\n4. In your suggestion, Please do not show any abbreviation of a atom or functional group. For example, when you need to show 'hydroxyl group', do not show '(OH)' in your suggestion!\n5. Each of your suggestion should be a sentence of modification instruction rather than a SMILES string.\n\n1) 6. Please note that your suggestion should also consider the similarity before and after modification.\n\n\n    Take a deep breath and let's think about the goal and guidelines step-by-step\nRemember, you should give your reasoning process first and finally return a python list named final_suggestion!\n"}]

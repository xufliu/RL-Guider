- Cc1nc2ccccn2c1-c1nnco1: Added an oxygen atom to the ring to increase HBA.
- Cc1nc2ccccn2c1-c1nncc(=O)oS1: Introduced a sulfoxide group (-SO-) which adds additional HBA sites.
- Cc1nc2ccccn2c1-c1nncco1: Added an extra oxygen in the form of an ether linkage.
- Cc1nc2ccccn2c1-c1nn(c(=O)O)S1: Replaced the single-bonded oxygen with a carboxyl group (-COO-), enhancing HBA.
- Cc1nc2ccccn2c1-c1nn(c(=O)N)S1: Introduced an amide group (-CONH-) which also increases HBA.

Each modification aims to preserve the overall structure while strategically adding functional groups that enhance hydrogen bonding capabilities.

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in your molecule, we can introduce atoms or functional groups that can act as acceptors, such as oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), or fluorine (F). Here are five modified molecules based on your input, each with an increased number of HBAs:

- CS[C@@H](C)C(=O)N1CCC(C(=O)NCc2ccc(F)c(O)c2)CC1
- CS[C@@H](C)C(=O)N1CCC(C(=O)NOCc2ccc(F)cc2)CC1

- CS[C@@H](C)C(=O)N1CCC(C(=O)NCc2ccc(F)c(c2)N)CC1

Each of these modifications introduces additional oxygen or nitrogen atoms into the aromatic ring or directly attached to it, thereby increasing the potential for hydrogen bonding as a hydrogen bond acceptor.

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in your molecule, we can introduce additional oxygen or nitrogen atoms that are capable of forming hydrogen bonds. Here are five modified molecules based on your input structure:

- CCOC[C@H]1CC[NH+](Cc2cc(OC)cc3c2O[C@@H](C)C(=O)O3)C1
- CCOC[C@H]1CC[NH+](Cc2cc(OC)cc3c2O[C@H](C)C(=O)N3)C1

- CCOC[C@H]1CC[NH+](Cc2cc(OC)cc3c2O[C@@H](C)C3O)C1

Each of these modifications introduces at least one additional potential hydrogen bond acceptor, either through the addition of an oxygen atom in a carbonyl group, an amide group, or through the introduction of a sulfoxide group, which enhances the HBA properties while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

- CC1(C)CCCC[C@H]1[NH2+]C[C@H](O)COc1ccc(N)c(F)c1
- CC1(C)CCCC[C@H]1[NH2+]C[C@H](O)COc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)O)c(F)c1
- CC1(C)CCCC[C@H]1[NH2+]C[C@H](O)COc1ccc(C(=O)O)c(F)c1
- CC1(C)CCCC[C@H]1[NH2+]C[C@H](O)COc1ccc(C(=O)N)c(F)c1

Each of these molecules introduces an additional HBA through the addition of oxygen or nitrogen atoms in positions that do not drastically alter the overall structure of the original molecule.

Here are five modified molecules based on your root molecule `N#CC1(NC(=O)C2=NN(c3ccccc3)[C@@H](c3ccccc3)C2)CCCC1`, each with additional hydrogen bond acceptors:

- **N#CC1(NC(=O)C2=NN(c3ccccc3)[C@@H](c3ccccc3)C2)CCOC1**: Introduced an ether group (-O-) to increase HBA.
- **N#CC1(NC(=O)C2=NN(c3ccccc3)[C@@H](c3ccccc3)C2)CCNC1**: Added an amine group (-NH2) to enhance HBA.
- **N#CC1(NC(=O)C2=NN(c3ccccc3)[C@@H](c3ccccc3)C2)CCFC1**: Introduced a fluorine atom (-F) to increase HBA.
- **N#CC1(NC(=O)C2=NN(c3ccccc3)[C@@H](c3ccccc3)C2)CC(O)CC1**: Added a hydroxyl group (-OH) to boost HBA.
- **N#CC1(NC(=O)C2=NN(c3ccccc3)[C@@H](c3ccccc3)C2)CCN(C)CC1**: Included a secondary amine group (-N(CH3)) to add more HBA potential.

These modifications aim to retain structural similarity while increasing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors.

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in your molecule, we can introduce additional heteroatoms such as oxygen or nitrogen into the structure. Here are five modified versions of your input molecule with increased HBA:

- CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]CC1O: Added an oxygen at the end to increase HBA.
- CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H](O)1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]CC1: Introduced an oxygen on the chiral carbon to increase HBA.
- CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]C(CN)C1: Replaced one of the terminal carbons with a nitrile group to add an additional nitrogen.
- CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]CC1N: Added an amine group at the end to increase HBA.
- CN(C)C(=O)N1CCC[C@H]1C(=O)N1CC[NH2+]CC(O)1: Introduced an oxygen within the ring structure to enhance HBA.

Each of these modifications aims to retain structural similarity while increasing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors.

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in your molecule, we can introduce additional heteroatoms such as oxygen or nitrogen, which are known to act as HBA. Below are five new molecules derived from your original structure, each with an increased number of HBAs:

- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)c(O)c1)C(=O)[O-] : Added an oxygen atom to the aromatic ring.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1O)C(=O)[O-] : Attached an oxygen directly to the aromatic ring.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1ccc(C#N)cn1O)C(=O)[O-] : Modified the aromatic ring to include an oxygen.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)O : Added an additional hydroxyl group (-OH) to the carboxyl group.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1ccc(C#N)c1N)C(=O)[O-] : Replaced one of the carbons in the aromatic ring with a nitrogen.

Each of these modifications aims to increase the number of potential hydrogen bond acceptors while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

AI answer 0: To increase the number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) in the molecule while keeping it similar to the original structure, we can introduce additional heteroatoms like oxygen or nitrogen that can act as HBA. Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format:

- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(O)c(Cl)c2Cl)no1
- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c(O)c2Cl)no1
- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2N)no1
- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2F)no1O
- Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2OC)no1

Each of these molecules has been modified to include additional oxygen or nitrogen atoms, which serve as hydrogen bond acceptors, thereby increasing the HBA count compared to the original molecule.

AI answer 0: To modify the given molecule to increase permeability and decrease tPSA (topological polar surface area), we can consider several strategies such as reducing polar groups, replacing them with less polar ones, or altering the molecular structure slightly to achieve the desired properties. Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format:

- **COc1cccc(NC(=O)CCCc2c(-c3ccc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(Cl)cc23)c1**: Replaced one fluorine with chlorine, which might reduce polarity slightly.
- **COc1cccc(NC(=O)CC(C)c2c(-c3ccc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(F)cc23)c1**: Introduced a methyl group on the central carbon of the amide linker to reduce flexibility and potentially lower tPSA.
- **COc1cccc(NC(=O)CCCc2c(-c3ccc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(c5ccccc5)cc23)c1**: Replaced the fluorine with a phenyl group, which can reduce the overall polarity and possibly improve permeability.
- **COc1cccc(NC(=O)CCCc2c(-c3ccc4ccccc4n3)[nH]c3ccc(S)cc23)c1**: Substituted the fluorine with sulfur, which is less electronegative and may help in decreasing tPSA.

AI answer 0: To improve the permeability and decrease the topological polar surface area (tPSA) of the given molecule, we can consider several modifications. These changes aim to reduce polar groups or introduce more lipophilic elements. Here are five proposed molecules:

- C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1F)[S@@](=O)Cc1nn(C)nn1C1CC1: Replaced one nitrogen in the pyridine-like ring with a methylated nitrogen to potentially reduce polarity.
- C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1F)[S@@](=O)Cc1nnn1C1CCC1: Changed one of the methylene groups in the cyclopropane to ethane, increasing hydrophobicity.
- C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1F)[S@](=O)Cc1nnnn1C1CC1: Altered the sulfur chirality which might influence the overall conformation and possibly its interaction with water.
- C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1Cl)[S@@](=O)Cc1nnnn1C1CC1: Replaced one fluorine with chlorine, which is less electronegative and could reduce the tPSA.
- C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl)[S@@](=O)Cc1nnnn1C1CC1: Replaced both fluorines with chlorines, further reducing the number of highly electronegative atoms that contribute to tPSA.

These modifications aim to keep the molecular structure as similar as possible to the original while targeting improvements in the specified properties.

AI answer 0: To modify the given molecule to increase permeability and decrease tPSA (topological polar surface area), we can consider several strategies such as reducing polar groups, introducing lipophilic groups, or altering the structure slightly to minimize polar surface area. Here are five new molecules derived from the root molecule with these considerations:

- **Cc1c(C(=O)N[C@H](C[S@@](C)=O)c2cccnc2)cnn1C(C)C**: Modified the phenyl ring to a pyridine ring, which can potentially alter the overall polarity and tPSA.
- **Cc1c(C(=O)N[C@H](C[S@@](C)=O)c2ccccc2)cnn1C(C)C(C)**: Added an additional methyl group to increase lipophilicity.
- **Cc1c(C(=O)N[C@H](C[S@@](C)=O)c2ccccc2)cnn1CC(C)C**: Extended the alkyl chain next to the triazole ring to enhance lipophilicity and reduce tPSA.

Here are five modified molecules that aim to achieve this goal while maintaining structural similarity to the original compound:

- CC[C@H]1CS/C(=N\c2ccccc2OC#CC)N1

AI answer 0: To improve the permeability and decrease the topological polar surface area (tPSA) of the molecule CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)[O-], we can make strategic modifications to reduce polar groups and enhance lipophilicity. Here are five modified molecules that aim to achieve these goals:

- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)OCC: This modification replaces the terminal carboxylate anion with an ester group, potentially reducing polarity.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)OC(C)C: Adding an isopropyl group to the ester increases lipophilicity and reduces tPSA.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)OCF3: Introducing a trifluoromethyl group enhances lipophilicity and decreases the overall polarity.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)OCCl: Replacing the terminal oxygen with a chlorine atom on the ester chain can reduce tPSA and increase lipophilicity.
- CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)OC(C)Cl: Combining an isopropyl group with a chlorine substituent on the ester aims to significantly alter the molecule's properties towards higher permeability and lower tPSA.

These modifications focus on altering the carboxylate group while maintaining the core structure similar to the original molecule.

AI answer 0: To improve the permeability and decrease the topological polar surface area (tPSA) of the molecule, we can consider several strategies such as reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, minimizing charged groups, and decreasing the overall polarity. Here are five modified molecules based on your starting structure:

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2Cl)c(F)c1** - Replaced one oxygen with fluorine to reduce hydrogen bonding capability.
- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2Cl)c(C)c1** - Introduced a methyl group instead of an oxygen-containing group to lower polarity.
- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2Cl)c(c1)C#N** - Added a nitrile group which is less polar than amide and reduces hydrogen bonding.
- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2Cl)c(c1)OC** - Changed the nitro group to an ester, reducing hydrogen bonding potential.
- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2ccc(Cl)c2Cl)c(c1)SC** - Replaced the nitro group with a thioether to reduce polarity and hydrogen bonding.

These modifications aim to reduce the tPSA and enhance permeability while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

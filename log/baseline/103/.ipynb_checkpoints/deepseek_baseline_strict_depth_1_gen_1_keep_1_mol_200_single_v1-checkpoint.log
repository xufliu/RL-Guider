AI answer 0: To increase the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of a molecule, we can consider several strategies such as improving the physicochemical properties, enhancing solubility, reducing potential toxicity, and ensuring good bioavailability. Based on your root molecule, here are five modified molecules that aim to improve these properties while maintaining structural similarity:

- **C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1F)[S@@](=O)Cc1nn(C)nn1C1CC1**: This modification introduces a methyl group on one of the nitrogen atoms in the pyridine-like ring, potentially enhancing lipophilicity and altering the electronic environment around the nitrogen.

- **C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1F)[S@@](=O)Cc1nnn1C1CCC1**: Here, an additional carbon atom is added to the cyclopropane ring, changing it to a cyclobutane. This alteration can affect the flexibility and conformational space of the molecule.

- **C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1F)[S@@](=O)Cc1nnn1C1COC1**: Replacing one of the methylene groups in the cyclopropane ring with an oxygen atom creates an ether linkage. This change can improve solubility and alter the interaction with biological targets.

- **C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1F)[S@@](=O)Cc1nnn1C1C(F)C1**: Introducing a fluorine atom on one of the carbons in the cyclopropane ring can enhance lipophilicity and metabolic stability.

- **C[C@@H](C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1F)[S@@](=O)Cc1nn(C)c1C1CC1**: Adding a double bond between two carbons in the heterocyclic ring can modify the electronic structure and potentially lead to better interactions with target proteins.

Each of these modifications aims to subtly alter the properties of the original molecule to potentially increase its drug-likeness score.

Each modification aims to alter specific functionalities or substituents in a way that could enhance the drug-like properties of the molecule, potentially improving its QED score. For instance, introducing polar groups like hydroxyl (-OH) can improve solubility, while substituting halogens can influence various physicochemical properties beneficial for drug design.

AI answer 0: To improve the drug-likeness and QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the given molecule, we can make several modifications while keeping the core structure similar. Here are five new molecules that aim to enhance these properties:

- **CC(C)c1ccc([C@@H]2C3=C(CCCC3=O)N[C@H]3N=NC(N)=C32)cc1**: This modification introduces an amine group (-NH2) in place of the hydroxyl group (-OH), potentially improving solubility and binding affinity.
  
- **CC(C)c1ccc([C@@H]2C3=C(CCCC3=O)N[C@H]3N=NC(F)=C32)cc1**: Replacing the oxygen with fluorine can increase lipophilicity and metabolic stability.

- **CC(C)c1ccc([C@@H]2C3=C(CCCC3=O)N[C@H]3N=NC(OCC)=C32)cc1**: Extending the ether chain (from -O to -OCC) can influence the pharmacokinetic properties, enhancing absorption or distribution.

- **CC(C)c1ccc([C@@H]2C3=C(CCCC3=O)N[C@H]3N=NC(S)=C32)cc1**: Substituting sulfur for oxygen might alter the reactivity and could lead to better interaction with biological targets.

- **CC(C)c1ccc([C@@H]2C3=C(CCCC3=O)N[C@H]3N=NC(OC)=C32)cc1**: Adding a methoxy group (-OCH3) can increase lipophilicity and modify the electronic properties of the molecule, potentially improving its binding to receptors.

Each of these modifications aims to subtly alter the chemical properties of the original molecule to enhance its drug-like characteristics while maintaining structural similarity.

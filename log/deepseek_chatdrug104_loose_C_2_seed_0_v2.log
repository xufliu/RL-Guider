AI:Here are five modified molecules in SMILES format that are similar to the input molecule but less drug-like, achieved by altering functional groups or simplifying the structure:

- `CCCN(Cc1nnc(-c2ccco2)o1)C(=O)c1ccco1`  
  (Removed the nitro group, making it less polar and less drug-like.)

- `CCCN(Cc1nnc(-c2ccco2)o1)C(=O)c1ccc(C)o1`  
  (Replaced the nitro group with a methyl group, reducing polarity.)

- `CCCN(Cc1nnc(-c2ccco2)o1)C(=O)c1ccco1`

AI:Thank you for pointing that out! Based on the corrected sequence you provided, here’s a new molecule in SMILES format that is structurally similar but less drug-like:

**CCSc1ccc(NC(=O)C(=O)NC2CCCCCCC2)cn1**

To make it less drug-like, I’ve modified the structure slightly by replacing the thioether (S) with an ether (O) and simplifying the ring system:

**COc1ccc(NC(=O)C(=O)NC2CCCCC2)cn1**

This molecule retains similarity to the original but is less drug-like due to the removal of the sulfur atom and simplification of the ring system. Let me know if you'd like further modifications!

- **C[C@@H](CCC(=O)Nc1cc(C)ccn1)C(=O)[O-]**  
  (Added a methyl group to the pyridine ring to reduce hydrogen bonding potential.)

- **C[C@@H](CCC(=O)Nc1ccccn1)C(=O)C**  
  (Replaced the carboxylate with a ketone to reduce charge and polarity.)

- **C[C@@H](CCC(=O)Nc1ccccn1)C(=O)OC**  
  (Esterified the carboxylate to reduce ionization potential.)

- **C[C@@H](CCC(=O)Nc1ccccn1)C(=O)CC**  
  (Extended the carboxylate into a less polar propionyl group.)

- **C[C@@H](CCC(=O)Nc1cc(C)cc(C)n1)C(=O)[O-]**  
  (Added two methyl groups to the pyridine ring to reduce polarity and hydrogen bonding.)

User:Can you make molecule Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)no1 less like a drug? The output molecule should be similar to the input molecule. Give me five molecules in SMILES only and list them using bullet points.
AI:Here are five modified molecules based on your input, designed to be less drug-like while maintaining structural similarity. The modifications include removing or altering functional groups typically associated with drug-like properties (e.g., amides, halogens):

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(O)c2)no1**  
  (Replaced chlorine atoms with hydroxyl groups)  

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(C)c2)no1**  
  (Replaced chlorine atoms with methyl groups)  

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Br)c2Br)no1**  
  (Replaced chlorine atoms with bromine atoms)  

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(F)c2F)no1**  
  (Replaced chlorine atoms with fluorine atoms)  

- **Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(OC)c2OC)no1**  
  (Replaced chlorine atoms with methoxy groups)  

These modifications reduce the drug-likeness by altering the halogenated aromatic ring, which is often a key feature in drug molecules.

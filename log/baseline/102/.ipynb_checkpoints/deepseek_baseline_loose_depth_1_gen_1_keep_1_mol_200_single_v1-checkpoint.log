- CCc1ccc(CNC(=O)C(=O)Nc2ccc(C(=O)OC(C)C)cc2)s1: Added a methyl group to the ester's alkyl chain to increase hydrophobicity.
- CCc1ccc(CNC(=O)C(=O)Nc2ccc(C(=O)OCC(C)C)cc2)s1: Introduced a tertiary butyl group on the ester to enhance hydrophobic interactions.
- CCc1ccc(CNC(=O)C(=O)Nc2ccc(C(=O)OCc3ccccc3)cc2)s1: Substituted the ester oxygen with a benzyl group to significantly increase hydrophobicity.
- CCc1ccc(CNC(=O)C(=O)Nc2ccc(C(=O)OC(C)(C)C)cc2)s1: Added two methyl groups to the ester's alkyl chain to further increase lipophilicity.

Each modification aims to increase the hydrophobic character of the molecule, thereby potentially increasing the logP value and reducing water solubility.

AI answer 0: To increase the logP and reduce the water solubility of the molecule, we can introduce more hydrophobic groups or increase the branching of existing alkyl chains. Here are five modified molecules based on your starting structure:

- COc1cc(C[NH+]2CCC(OC[C@H]3CCCC3)CC2)ccc1SC
- COc1cc(C[NH+]2CCC(OC[C@@H]3CCCC3)CC2)ccc1SC

AI answer 0: To achieve the goal of reducing water solubility and increasing the logP value, we can introduce more hydrophobic groups or increase the molecular weight without significantly altering the core structure. Here are five modified molecules based on your starting molecule:

- C[C@H](Cc1ccsc1)N(C)C(=O)c1nn(-c2ccc(F)cc2)cc1OC: This molecule replaces the negatively charged oxygen with a neutral methoxy group, potentially decreasing solubility and increasing logP.

- C[C@H](Cc1ccsc1)N(C)C(=O)c1nn(-c2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1[O-]: Here, the fluorine atom is replaced with a chlorine atom, which is bulkier and more hydrophobic, thus likely increasing logP.

- C[C@H](Cc1ccsc1)N(C)C(=O)c1nn(-c2ccc(CF3)cc2)cc1[O-]: This molecule introduces a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) to the benzene ring, enhancing hydrophobicity and increasing logP.

- C[C@H](Cc1ccsc1)N(C)C(=O)c1nn(-c2ccc(CN)cc2)cc1[O-]: Adding a nitrile group (-CN) increases the molecular weight and hydrophobicity, contributing to a higher logP value.

- C[C@H](Cc1ccsc1)N(C)C(=O)c1nn(-c2ccc(C=C)cc2)cc1[O-]: Introducing an additional double bond in the side chain can reduce solubility and slightly increase logP due to increased hydrophobic interactions.

These modifications aim to retain structural similarity while achieving the desired changes in solubility and logP.

AI answer 0: To reduce water solubility and increase the logP value of the molecule, we can introduce more hydrophobic groups or remove polar functionalities. Here are five modified molecules that should have these properties:

- **COC[C@H](C)CNC(=O)N[C@@H]1CCCCC[C@@H]1C(=O)OC**: This modification replaces the carboxylate group (-COO-) with an ester (-COOCH3), which is less polar and thus reduces water solubility and increases logP.

- **COC[C@H](C)CNC(=O)N[C@@H]1CCCCC[C@@H]1C(=O)CC**: Introducing an additional methyl group to the carboxylic acid creates an amide linkage with a methyl group, increasing hydrophobicity and potentially raising logP.

- **COC[C@H](C)CNC(=O)N[C@@H]1CCCCC[C@@H]1C(=O)C(C)C**: Adding two methyl groups to the terminal carbon of the carboxylic acid chain increases the hydrophobic character, likely decreasing solubility in water and increasing logP.

- **COC[C@H](C)CNC(=O)N[C@@H]1CCCCC[C@@H]1C(=O)C(F)(F)F**: Replacing the carboxylate group with a trifluoromethyl ketone significantly increases hydrophobicity due to the fluorine atoms, which should decrease water solubility and increase logP.

- **COC[C@H](C)CNC(=O)N[C@@H]1CCCCC[C@@H]1C(=O)C#N**: Converting the carboxylate group into a nitrile (-CN) removes the charge and adds a highly hydrophobic group, reducing water solubility and increasing logP.

These modifications aim to retain the structural similarity to the original molecule while achieving the desired changes in solubility and logP.

AI answer 0: To decrease the water solubility and increase the logP value of the molecule, we can introduce more hydrophobic groups or increase the molecular weight by adding non-polar substituents. Here are five modified molecules based on your starting structure:

- **COc1ccc2c(CN(CCO)Cc3ccccc3)cc(=O)OC(C)C**: Added an ethyl group to the ester oxygen, increasing hydrophobicity.
- **COc1ccc2c(CN(CCO)Cc3ccccc3)cc(=O)oc2c1(C)**: Introduced a methyl group attached directly to the aromatic ring, enhancing lipophilicity.
- **COc1ccc2c(CN(CCO)Cc3ccccc3)cc(=O)oc2c1Cl**: Replaced a hydrogen with a chlorine atom, which is more electronegative but still increases hydrophobic interactions.
- **COc1ccc2c(CN(CCO)Cc3ccccc3)cc(=O)OC(C)c4ccccc4**: Added a benzyl group to the ester oxygen, significantly increasing the hydrophobic surface area.
- **COc1ccc2c(CN(CCO)Cc3ccccc3)cc(=O)OC(C)(C)C**: Increased the alkyl chain length on the ester oxygen to a tert-butyl group, enhancing lipophilicity.

These modifications aim to reduce water solubility and increase the logP value while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

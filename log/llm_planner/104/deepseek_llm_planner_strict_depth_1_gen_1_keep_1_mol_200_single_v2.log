AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity, we should focus on modifications that disrupt key drug-like properties. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and other factors. To decrease QED, we should aim to introduce features that are less desirable in drug molecules, such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding bulky groups, or disrupting hydrogen bonding.

Here’s the strategy:
1. **Replace the Amino Group (NH2+)**: The positively charged amino group is a common feature in drug molecules, contributing to hydrogen bonding and solubility. Replacing it with a less polar or bulkier group would decrease QED.
2. **Add a Bulky Hydrophobic Group**: Introducing a bulky hydrophobic group, such as a phenyl ring, would decrease QED by increasing hydrophobicity and molecular weight.
3. **Disrupt the Hydrogen Bonding**: Removing or replacing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors can decrease QED.

Given the constraints and the need to maintain similarity, the most effective modification would be to **replace the positively charged amino group with a hydrophobic group** while keeping the rest of the molecule intact. This change will disrupt the hydrogen bonding and increase hydrophobicity, effectively decreasing QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the positively charged amino group with a phenyl group to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce modifications that reduce the drug-like properties. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding bulky or non-drug-like groups can decrease QED.
2. **Introduce Polarity**: Adding polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, nitro) can decrease QED.
3. **Decrease Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED.
4. **Increase Flexibility**: Introducing rotatable bonds can decrease QED.
5. **Introduce Non-Drug-Like Groups**: Adding groups that are uncommon in drugs (e.g., nitro, sulfone) can decrease QED.

Given the structure of the molecule, one effective way to decrease QED while maintaining similarity is to replace a hydrogen bond acceptor or donor with a less favorable group or introduce a bulky, non-drug-like substituent.

### Reasoning Process:
- The molecule contains an amide group (`NC(=O)C(=O)N`) which is a strong hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. Replacing part of this group with a less favorable functional group would significantly impact QED.
- Another approach is to introduce a bulky substituent on the aromatic ring, which would increase molecular weight and decrease QED.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the above reasoning, the best suggestion is:

- **Replace the amide group (`NC(=O)C(=O)N`) with a nitro group (`NO2`)**. This would decrease the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, reduce drug-likeness, and significantly decrease QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a nitro group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: The task is to modify the given molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while keeping the modified molecules structurally similar to the original molecule.
2. **QED Analysis**: The current QED of the molecule is 0.829. To decrease it by at least 0.1, the target QED should be ≤ 0.729.
3. **Structural Analysis**: The molecule contains a positively charged amino group (`[NH2+]`), a fluorinated aromatic ring (`c1c(F)cccc1F`), and a heterocyclic ring (`c1ncoc1`). These features contribute to its drug-likeness.
4. **Modification Strategy**:
   - To decrease QED, we should introduce less favorable drug-like features, such as:
     - Increasing molecular weight or hydrophobicity.
     - Adding bulky or non-polar groups.
     - Disrupting hydrogen bonding or aromaticity.
   - To maintain structural similarity, modifications should be conservative and avoid drastic changes.
5. **Proposed Action**: Replace the positively charged amino group (`[NH2+]`) with a less polar and bulkier group, such as a tert-butyl group. This modification increases hydrophobicity and steric bulk, which will decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug, decrease its QED by at least 0.1, and maintain structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **QED Analysis:** The QED of the root molecule is 0.6009762687271423. Therefore, the QED of the modified molecule should be less than 0.5009762687271423.

3. **Target Modification Focus:**
   - The QED is influenced by factors like molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors, hydrogen bond acceptors, logP, and polar surface area.
   - To reduce QED, we should consider increasing molecular weight, adding hydrophobic groups, or reducing polar surface area.

4. **Structural Similarity:** The modifications should not drastically alter the main scaffold of the molecule, ensuring similarity to the root molecule.

5. **Previous Experience:** We should avoid repeating previous suggestions and focus on new structural changes.

6. **Suggested Action:** Replace a polar group with a non-polar or less polar group to reduce QED while maintaining similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The task is to modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should remain structurally similar to the root molecule.

2. **QED Considerations**: The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, and the number of rotatable bonds. To decrease QED, we need to make changes that negatively impact these properties.

3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. The focus should be on modifying functional groups or adding/removing atoms that do not disrupt the overall scaffold.

4. **Previous Experience**: Based on typical drug design principles, adding bulky groups, increasing hydrophobicity, or introducing groups that reduce solubility can decrease QED.

5. **Action Space**: The modifications can involve adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups.

6. **Final Decision**: To achieve the goal, I will suggest adding a bulky, hydrophobic group to one of the accessible positions on the molecule. This modification should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to consider modifications that introduce less drug-like features. Based on the structure of the root molecule (`COC(=O)C(C)(C)[C@H]1CCC[NH+](Cc2nc3cc(Cl)ccc3n2C)C1`), the following reasoning can be applied:

1. **Decrease Drug-Likeness**: QED is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and the presence of certain functional groups. Introducing bulky or hydrophobic groups or reducing polarity can decrease QED.
2. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core scaffold of the molecule. Changes should focus on peripheral groups or small regions of the molecule.

### Suggested Modifications:
- **Replace the ester group (`COC(=O)`) with a less polar group**: Esters contribute to drug-likeness, and replacing them with a less polar group like an ether or hydrocarbon can decrease QED.
- **Introduce a bulky hydrophobic group**: Adding a bulky group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) can reduce QED by increasing molecular weight and hydrophobicity.
- **Remove or replace the chloro group (`Cl`)**: The chloro group is a common feature in drug-like molecules. Replacing it with a less drug-like halogen (e.g., iodine) can decrease QED.
- **Replace the tertiary amine (`[NH+]`) with a less polar group**: Amines are highly polar and contribute to drug-likeness. Replacing them with a less polar group (e.g., an ether or hydrocarbon) can decrease QED.
- **Introduce steric hindrance**: Adding groups that increase steric hindrance (e.g., methyl groups) can decrease QED by reducing molecular flexibility and increasing hydrophobicity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ester group (COC(=O)) with a hydrocarbon group to decrease polarity and drug-likeness."]

AI Suggestion 0: To address the goal of decreasing the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to make modifications that reduce drug-like properties. The QED value is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, solubility, lipophilicity, and the presence of specific functional groups. To decrease QED, we can introduce or modify features such as bulky groups, polar atoms, or functional groups that are less favorable for drug-likeness.

Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Add a polar functional group**: Adding polar groups like a hydroxyl group or carboxyl group can increase polarity and reduce drug-likeness.
2. **Introduce a bulkier group**: Adding a large, non-drug-like group (e.g., a cyclohexyl or phenyl ring) can decrease QED.
3. **Replace a drug-like functional group**: Replacing a group like the ester (OC(=O)) with a less drug-like group (e.g., a sulfonamide) can reduce QED.
4. **Introduce a charged group**: Adding or replacing with a charged group (e.g., a quaternary ammonium or a sulfonate) can decrease drug-likeness.
5. **Increase molecular weight**: Adding a heavier atom or group (e.g., a bromine or iodine) can lower QED.

Based on these principles, here’s the top suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ester group (OC(=O)) with a sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O))."]
``` 

This modification introduces a less drug-like functional group while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule, and it is expected to decrease the QED value significantly.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the molecule `C[C@H](NCC(C)(C)[NH+]1CCN(C)CC1)c1ccc(Cl)s1` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should retain structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **QED Considerations**: The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, polarity, aromaticity, and the presence of specific functional groups. To decrease QED, we can introduce features that reduce drug-likeness, such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding bulky groups, or reducing polarity.

3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule, such as the central chiral carbon, the aromatic ring, and the amine groups.

4. **Suggested Modifications**:
   - **Add a hydrophobic group**: Introducing a hydrophobic group (e.g., alkyl chain) can reduce drug-likeness and decrease QED.
   - **Replace a polar group with a non-polar group**: For example, replacing an amine group with a methyl group can reduce polarity.
   - **Add a bulky group**: Introducing a bulky group (e.g., tertiary butyl) can sterically hinder the molecule, reducing drug-likeness.

5. **Final Suggestion**: Based on the above reasoning, the top suggestion is to **add a long alkyl chain to the aromatic ring** to increase hydrophobicity and decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a long alkyl chain to the aromatic ring to increase hydrophobicity."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness. The Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, logP, the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, and the number of rotatable bonds. 

**Reasoning Process:**

1. **Reduce Hydrogen Bond Acceptors/Donors:** Removing or replacing functional groups that contribute to hydrogen bonding (e.g., amide, nitro, or hydroxyl groups) can decrease QED since these groups are favorable in drug-like molecules.

2. **Increase LogP:** Introducing more hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains or aromatic rings) can increase logP, which might decrease QED.

3. **Increase Molecular Weight:** Adding larger substituents can increase molecular weight, potentially reducing QED if it pushes the molecule outside the optimal range.

4. **Modify Rotatable Bonds:** Reducing the number of rotatable bonds can decrease molecular flexibility, which is less favorable in drug-like molecules.

Considering the structure of the root molecule, **the amide group (-C(=O)-NH-) is a significant contributor to hydrogen bonding and drug-likeness**. Replacing this group with a less polar or non-polar group can effectively decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

**Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (-C(=O)-NH-) with a methylene group (-CH2-) to decrease hydrogen bonding and reduce drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.6717, so the target QED after modification should be less than or equal to 0.5717.
3. **Structural Analysis**: The root molecule contains an aromatic ring system with nitrogen atoms, a fluoro group, and a secondary amine linkage. To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-likeness, such as adding bulky groups, removing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or increasing hydrophobicity.
4. **Modification Strategy**: A suitable strategy would be to replace the fluoro group on the benzene ring with a more hydrophobic and bulky group, which would decrease QED and maintain structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluoro group on the benzene ring with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the `root_molecule` by at least 0.1 and make it less like a drug while maintaining structural similarity, we can consider the following reasoning:

1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: The QED score is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as increasing molecular weight or logP, or altering hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

2. **Structural Similarity**: To keep the molecule similar to the input, modifications should target specific functional groups or atoms while preserving the core structure. 

3. **Specific Changes**: Adding bulky or non-polar groups (e.g., alkyl or aromatic groups) can increase molecular weight and logP, thereby reducing QED. Removing polar groups (e.g., amide or carbonyl) can also decrease drug-likeness.

4. **Targeted Modification**: The carbonyl group (`C=O`) in the amide or the bromine atom on the aromatic ring can be modified to introduce less drug-like features.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a methylene group to reduce polarity and hydrogen bonding potential."]
``` 

This modification decreases the QED by reducing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors and altering the logP, while maintaining structural similarity to the `root_molecule`.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that reduce drug-likeness. Drug-likeness is often associated with specific properties such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and the presence of certain functional groups. Here are the key steps for the reasoning process:

1. **Identify functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness**: The molecule contains amide groups, a chlorine atom, and a pyrazole ring, which are common in drug-like molecules. Modifying these groups can reduce drug-likeness.

2. **Increase hydrophobicity or steric bulk**: Adding hydrophobic or bulky groups can decrease QED by making the molecule less soluble or less likely to interact with biological targets.

3. **Reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors**: Decreasing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can reduce drug-likeness, as these groups are often crucial for binding to biological targets.

4. **Maintain similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to ensure it remains similar to the original.

Based on this reasoning, the top suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (C(=O)N) with an ester group (C(=O)O) to reduce hydrogen bonding potential and decrease drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should still retain structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To reduce QED, we should introduce changes that negatively impact these properties, such as increasing molecular weight, making the molecule more lipophilic, or reducing polarity.

3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should be subtle to maintain similarity. This means targeting small functional groups or atoms rather than making large-scale changes.

4. **Action Space**: Based on the action space provided, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. The modifications should focus on functional groups that are likely to decrease QED without drastically altering the core structure.

5. **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure the suggestion does not repeat any previous modifications.

6. **Specificity**: The suggestion should explicitly describe the modification without using abbreviations.

### Suggested Modification:

Replace the hydroxyl group with a methyl group. This change increases lipophilicity and reduces polarity, which would likely decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Understanding the Goal**: The goal is to modify the `root_molecule` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **QED Reduction**: To reduce QED, we should consider modifications that introduce less drug-like features, such as adding bulky groups, increasing hydrophobicity, or introducing less common functional groups.
3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should be subtle to ensure the new molecules remain similar to the original.
4. **Action Space**: Based on the action space, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. To reduce QED, replacing or adding less drug-like groups would be effective.
5. **Avoid Repetition**: The suggestion should not repeat previous modifications.

### Suggestion:
One effective way to reduce QED while maintaining similarity is to replace the nitro group (O=[N+]([O-])) with a less drug-like functional group, such as a sulfoxide group (S=O). This change introduces a less common functional group, which can decrease drug-likeness and QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a sulfoxide group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness. One effective approach is to introduce structural changes that disrupt key drug-like properties, such as adding bulky groups, removing functional groups, or altering aromatic systems. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Adding bulky groups can decrease the molecule’s drug-likeness by increasing its molecular weight and complexity, which often reduces QED.

2. **Remove Functional Groups**: Removing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness (e.g., amide, aromatic rings) can also decrease QED.

3. **Alter Aromatic Systems**: Modifying aromatic rings (e.g., by adding substituents or breaking the aromaticity) can reduce QED by disrupting planar structures that are often beneficial in drugs.

Given the structure of the root molecule, one effective modification would be to **add a bulky group to the aromatic ring system**, which would decrease the QED while maintaining some structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a tert-butyl group to the aromatic ring connected to the nitrogen atom in the indole-like structure."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity, we need to consider modifications that introduce features that are less drug-like. This can be achieved by adding or modifying functional groups, altering the molecule's polarity, or changing its size. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Add a bulky group**: Introducing a bulky group can decrease the molecule's drug-likeness by affecting its solubility and molecular weight.
2. **Replace a sulfur atom with a less polar atom**: Sulfur atoms contribute to the drug-likeness. Replacing them with less polar atoms like carbon could decrease QED.
3. **Remove a polar functional group**: Polar functional groups increase drug-likeness. Removing or replacing them with non-polar groups can reduce QED.
4. **Add a non-aromatic ring**: Adding a non-aromatic ring can decrease the molecule's resemblance to typical drug structures.
5. **Replace a nitrogen atom with a carbon atom**: Nitrogen atoms are common in drug molecules. Replacing them with carbon atoms can reduce drug-likeness.

Given the constraints, the best suggestion is to **replace a sulfur atom with a carbon atom** in the thioether group, as this will decrease the molecule's drug-likeness by reducing its polarity and sulfur content.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfur atom in the thioether group with a carbon atom."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. Here are some key considerations:

1. **QED Reduction**: To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less desirable in drug-like molecules, such as increasing molecular weight, reducing solubility, or adding non-pharmacophoric groups.

2. **Similarity Maintenance**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. Changes should focus on peripheral groups or minor alterations to the backbone.

3. **Previous Experience**: From the previous prompts, we know that adding large or hydrophobic groups tends to decrease QED significantly. Also, introducing charged groups that are not pharmacophoric can have a negative impact on drug-likeness.

4. **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure that the suggestion does not repeat previous modifications, such as adding hydroxyl groups or other common functional groups.

5. **Modification Instruction**: The suggestion should be a clear, actionable sentence describing the change to be made.

Based on these considerations, the best action to achieve the goal is to add a large hydrophobic group to the molecule. This will increase the molecular weight and reduce solubility, thereby decreasing QED.

### Reasoning Process:
1. Identify a position in the molecule where a large hydrophobic group can be added without disrupting the core structure.
2. Choose a group that is not pharmacophoric and is likely to reduce drug-likeness.
3. Ensure the modification does not drastically alter the overall shape or pharmacophore of the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

**Step 1: Analyze the QED Value and Objective**

- The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule (EqM3) is 0.8469614231671394.
- The objective is to decrease the QED by at least 0.1, making the molecule less drug-like while keeping it structurally similar to the input molecule.

**Step 2: Understand the QED Parameters**

QED is influenced by several molecular properties such as
- LogP (lipophilicity)
- Molecular weight
- Hydrogen bond donors/acceptors
- Polar surface area
- Number of rotatable bonds
- Aromatic rings

To decrease QED, we need to make modifications that
- Increase LogP (making the molecule more lipophilic)
- Increase molecular weight (adding larger substituents)
- Reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors balance
- Modify the polar surface area (increase/decrease)
- Increase the number of rotatable bonds or aromatic rings

**Step 3: Identify Key Features in the Root Molecule**

Key features of the root molecule include
- **C1** - A central Aliphatic chain with two Carbons and a chiral center.
- **C7** - A Nitrogen atom directly connected to C1, forming an amine group. The Nitrogen is also connected to a Carbonyl group and another Nitrogen atom, which is connected to an aromatic ring and a methoxy group.
- **C8** - An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent and a Carbonyl group connected.

**Step 4: Select Areas for Modification**

Modification areas to consider
- **Aromatic ring with chlorine atom (C8)**: Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group and affects the polarity and LogP.
- **Amine group (C7)**: The amine group can be replaced or modified to alter hydrogen bonding and polarity.
- **Chiral center (C1)**: Stereochemistry can impact drug-likeness, but it is not a direct contributor to QED.
- **Methoxy group (OCH3)**: The Methoxy group is polar and can be modified to affect the polar surface area and LogP.

**Step 5: Generate Possible Modifications**

To reduce the QED, consider the following changes
1. **Replace the chlorine atom with a more lipophilic substituent** (e.g., a methyl group).
2. **Replace the methoxy group with a less polar group** (e.g., a methyl group).
3. **Introduce additional substituents that increase molecular weight** without making it significantly polar.
4. **Change the amine group to a less polar group** (e.g., a methyl group instead of amine).
5. Introduce **a larger, lipophilic group** as a substituent on one of the aromatic rings.

Each of these changes will increase the lipophilicity and/or molecular weight, thereby decreasing the QED. The modifications should ensure that the structural similarity is maintained as per the guidelines.

**Step 6: Prioritize Actions Based on Potential Impact and Similarity**

Amongst the likely effective modifications
- **Replace the chlorine atom with a more lipophilic substituent**: Chlorine is a moderately polar halogen. Introducing a methyl group will keep the molecule structurally similar while increasing lipophilicity.
- **Replace the methoxy group with a methyl group**: This reduces polarity and increases LogP, significantly impacting QED.

**Final Decision**

The top modification to suggest is
- **Replace the chlorine atom on the aromatic ring with a methyl group**. This modification decreases polarity and increases lipophilicity, likely reducing the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the chlorine atom on the aromatic ring with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: Modify the molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Guiding Principles**:
   - **QED Reduction**: To decrease QED, we should introduce features that are less drug-like, such as bulky groups, nonpolar substituents, or groups that disrupt favorable drug properties.
   - **Structural Similarity**: The modification should not drastically alter the core structure to ensure the molecule remains similar to the original.
   - **Avoid Repeating Previous Suggestions**: Ensure the suggestion is novel and not repetitive.
3. **Strategy**:
   - Replace a polar or hydrogen-bonding group with a nonpolar or less favorable group (e.g., aromatic ring substitution).
   - Introduce steric bulk to disrupt favorable drug properties.
   - Modify functional groups that contribute to QED positively (e.g., amides, carbonyls).

### Suggested Action:
Replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a less polar or nonpolar group, such as a methylene group, to reduce QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a methylene group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the root molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify Functional Groups Contributing to Drug-Likeness**: The root molecule has an ammonium group (NH2+), a carboxylate group (C(=O)[O-]), and a chlorine atom (Cl) which are common in drug molecules. Modifying these groups can reduce drug-likeness.

2. **Maintain Similarity**: To keep the molecule similar to the root molecule, we should avoid drastic changes like adding or removing large rings or altering the core structure significantly.

3. **Decrease QED**: The QED can be decreased by adding less favorable groups for drug-likeness, such as bulky hydrophobic groups or less polar groups, or by removing polar groups like the carboxylate.

Given these considerations, the top suggestion is:

**Replace the carboxylate group (C(=O)[O-]) with a methyl group (CH3).** 

This modification removes a polar functional group and adds a non-polar group, which should decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carboxylate group with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Decrease the QED of the `root_molecule` by at least 0.1 while keeping the molecule structurally similar. The current QED is 0.767, so the target QED should be ≤ 0.667.
2. **Strategy**: Structural modifications that reduce drug-likeness often involve:
   - Adding bulky or polar groups that hinder absorption or increase hydrophilicity.
   - Removing or replacing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness (e.g., amides, aromatic rings).
3. **Preserving Similarity**: Modifications should focus on peripheral groups rather than the core scaffold to maintain similarity to the `root_molecule`.
4. **Prior Experience**: Previous suggestions might have involved functional group replacements (e.g., hydroxyl groups, halogens) or ring modifications. This time, we can explore adding polar or bulky groups at specific positions.
5. **Action**: Add a sulfonate group (–SO3H) to the phenyl ring. Sulfonate groups are highly polar and negatively charged, which drastically reduce drug-likeness and QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a sulfonate group to the phenyl ring at the para position relative to the amide group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modifications should maintain similarity to the root molecule.

2. **Current QED**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.7316308004097274. Therefore, the target QED after modification should be less than or equal to 0.6316308004097274.

3. **Action Space**: We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups to achieve this goal. The modifications should be strategic to reduce QED while maintaining molecular similarity.

4. **Previous Experience**: Based on the substructure changes of molecules, reducing drug-like properties often involves adding bulky or polar groups, or removing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness.

5. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should retain the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.

6. **Avoiding Repetition**: The suggestions should not repeat previous modifications.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) attached to the nitrogen with a sulfonyl group (SO2)."]
``` 

This modification is chosen because replacing the carbonyl group with a sulfonyl group will increase the polarity and bulkiness, making the molecule less drug-like and thereby decreasing the QED. This change also maintains the core structure of the molecule, ensuring similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, we can consider the following reasoning:

1. **QED Reduction**: The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) score is influenced by molecular properties such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and presence of specific functional groups. To reduce QED, we can introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as adding bulky groups, increasing hydrophobicity, or introducing less common functional groups.

2. **Structural Similarity**: The modified molecules should retain some similarity to the original molecule. This can be achieved by making small, localized changes rather than large-scale alterations.

3. **Objective**: The goal is to decrease QED by at least 0.1 while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

Based on these considerations, the following modification can be suggested to decrease QED:

- **Replace the hydroxyl group with a more hydrophobic group**: The hydroxyl group is polar and contributes to drug-likeness. Replacing it with a less polar group, such as a methyl group, can reduce the QED score.

This modification is expected to decrease the QED by increasing hydrophobicity and reducing the overall drug-likeness of the molecule.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group with a methyl group to decrease hydrophilicity and reduce QED."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the root molecule, we need to consider modifications that reduce the drug-like properties. Here are some strategies:

1. **Reduce hydrogen bond donors or acceptors**: Decreasing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can lower the QED. For example, modifying or removing the ammonium group could be effective.
2. **Increase molecular weight**: Adding larger hydrophobic groups can decrease the QED.
3. **Introduce steric hindrance**: Adding bulky groups can make the molecule less drug-like.
4. **Remove aromaticity**: Aromatic rings are often key features in drugs, so modifying the aromatic ring could reduce drug-likeness.

Based on these strategies, one effective modification would be to **replace the ammonium group with a bulky hydrophobic group**, such as an isopropyl group. This change would reduce the hydrogen bond donor count and increase the hydrophobicity, both of which would lower the QED.

### Reasoning Process:  
- **Target Feature**: The ammonium group ([NH3+]) is a hydrogen bond donor and a polar feature that contributes to drug-likeness.  
- **Modification**: Replacing it with a bulky hydrophobic group reduces polarity and increases molecular weight, lowering QED.  
- **Similarity**: The overall structure remains similar, as the rest of the molecule is unchanged.  

### Final Suggestion:  
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ammonium group with an isopropyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the `root_molecule` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while keeping the new molecules similar to the original structure.

2. **QED Considerations**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, polarity, hydrogen bonding, and aromaticity. To decrease QED, we need to introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or disrupting aromaticity.

3. **Similarity Consideration**: To maintain similarity, the modifications should be subtle, such as replacing functional groups or adding small substituents, rather than making drastic changes to the core structure.

4. **Action Space**: Based on the `action_space`, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. Adding polar or bulky groups is a good strategy to decrease QED.

5. **Previous Experience**: From previous experiences, adding polar groups like hydroxyl groups or replacing aromatic carbons with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen or oxygen) can effectively decrease QED.

6. **Final Suggestion**: Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) in the acetyl group (CC(=O)) with a hydroxyl group (OH) to disrupt the aromaticity and increase polarity, thereby decreasing QED.

### Python List:  

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the acetyl group with a hydroxyl group"]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to make the molecule less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The QED of the root molecule is currently **0.852**, so the target QED should be **< 0.752**.

2. **Strategy**:
   - To decrease QED, we should introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. This can be achieved by:
     - Adding bulky or non-drug-like functional groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl, or long aliphatic chains).
     - Removing or replacing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amine).
     - Introducing sterically hindering groups or reducing solubility.

3. **Molecule Analysis**:
   - The root molecule has a thiazole ring (`S2C=CC=N`), a pyridine-like ring (`c1nocn1`), and an aliphatic chain (`CCCC`).
   - To reduce drug-likeness, we can modify the aliphatic chain or the rings.

4. **Action Space**:
   - **Add**: Introduce a bulky or non-polar group (e.g., nitro, tert-butyl).
   - **Replace**: Exchange a polar group with a non-polar one (e.g., replace an amine with a methyl group).
   - **Delete**: Remove a functional group that contributes to drug-likeness.

5. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should retain structural similarity to the root molecule while achieving the QED decrease.

### Top Suggestion:
- **Replace the nitrogen atom in the thiazole ring with a sulfur atom**, which reduces polarity and increases steric hindrance, making the molecule less drug-like.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitrogen atom in the thiazole ring with a sulfur atom."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that reduce drug-like properties while maintaining structural similarity. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors like molecular weight, polarity, and the presence of functional groups. To lower QED, we can:

1. **Increase molecular weight or hydrophobicity**: Adding bulky or hydrophobic groups can reduce QED.
2. **Introduce less drug-like functional groups**: For example, replacing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups with less polar or non-polar groups.
3. **Remove or replace functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness**: For example, replacing amide or ester groups with less polar alternatives.

Given the structure of the root molecule (`CCc1ccc(CNC(=O)C(=O)Nc2ccc(C(=O)OC)cc2)s1`), we can target the amide or ester groups for modification, as these contribute to drug-likeness.

**Reasoning Process:**
- The molecule has two amide groups (`NC(=O)C(=O)N`) and one ester group (`C(=O)OC`).
- Replacing one of these groups with a less polar or bulkier group could reduce QED.
- For example, replacing one of the amide groups with a less polar group like a thioether or a simple alkyl chain could work.

**Final Suggestion:**
Based on the above reasoning, the top-1 suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the amide groups (NC(=O)C(=O)N) with a thioether group (S)."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **QED Decrease**: The current QED of the root molecule is 0.8378930986222082, so the target QED after modification should be below 0.7378930986222082.
3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.
4. **Action Space**: The allowed actions are adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups.
5. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we can introduce less desirable drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular weight, adding hydrophobic groups, or reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

**Suggested Modification**:
- Replace the bromine atom with a bulkier, more hydrophobic group like a phenyl ring. This will increase molecular weight and hydrophobicity, both of which typically decrease QED.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** Modify the molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **Guidelines:** 
   - Make changes that are known to decrease drug-likeness, such as adding bulky groups, introducing less common functional groups, or disrupting the molecular planarity.
   - Ensure the modifications do not drastically alter the core structure to maintain similarity.
   - Avoid repeating previous suggestions and use full descriptions of atoms or functional groups.

3. **Current Best Molecule Analysis:**
   - The molecule contains a carbonyl group, a nitrile group, and an aromatic ring with an amide linkage.
   - To decrease QED, we can introduce less favorable features, such as a bulky or hydrophobic group, or modify the existing functional groups to less drug-like variants.

4. **Potential Modifications:**
   - Adding a bulky group to the aromatic ring.
   - Replacing the nitrile group with a less common functional group.
   - Introducing a sterically hindered group near the carbonyl group.

5. **Final Suggestion:**
   - Add a bulky tertiary butyl group to the aromatic ring to introduce steric hindrance and decrease drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a tertiary butyl group to the aromatic ring at the position adjacent to the amide linkage."]

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule to decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule. The current QED of the root molecule is 0.648, so the target QED should be ≤0.548.

2. **Strategy**: 
   - To decrease QED, we need to introduce less drug-like features. Common strategies include:
     - Adding or modifying functional groups that are less common in drugs (e.g., long aliphatic chains, large hydrophobic groups, or uncommon heterocycles).
     - Decreasing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors or increasing molecular weight/logP.
     - Introducing bulky or polar groups that disrupt drug-likeness.
   - However, the molecule should still remain structurally similar to the original, so drastic changes (e.g., removing rings or key functional groups) should be avoided.

3. **Action**: Based on the molecule's structure, we can:
   - Add a long aliphatic chain to the molecule to increase hydrophobicity and molecular weight.
   - Replace the cyano group (-C#N) with a bulkier and less drug-like group.
   - Add a large, non-drug-like substituent to the nitrogen in the [NH+] group.
   - Modify the ester group (CCO) to a less drug-like functional group.

4. **Final Suggestion**: 
   - The best action is to **replace the cyano group with a bulky, less drug-like substituent**, such as a tert-butyl group. This will increase hydrophobicity and molecular weight while maintaining structural similarity.

Here’s the `final_suggestion` list:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the cyano group attached to the carbon chain with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we need to make structural changes that reduce drug-likeness. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To lower QED, we can introduce changes that increase hydrophobicity, reduce hydrogen bonding capacity, or increase molecular complexity in unfavorable ways.

Here’s the reasoning process:
1. **Increase hydrophobicity**: Adding non-polar groups like alkyl chains can decrease QED by increasing logP.
2. **Reduce hydrogen bonding capacity**: Removing or replacing polar groups (e.g., carbonyl or amine groups) with non-polar groups can reduce QED.
3. **Introduce steric hindrance**: Adding bulky groups can reduce drug-likeness by making the molecule less favorable for binding.

Based on these considerations, the following modification is suggested to achieve the goal:
- Replace the carbonyl group with a non-polar methylene group. This reduces hydrogen bonding capacity and increases hydrophobicity, which should lower QED significantly.

Here is the final suggestion in the required format:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group with a methylene group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that introduce less drug-like features while maintaining structural similarity. Here's the reasoning process:

1. **Objective**: Decrease QED by >0.1 and maintain structural similarity.
2. **Strategy**:
   - Introduce bulky or non-drug-like groups (e.g., long alkyl chains, non-aromatic rings).
   - Remove or replace polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., amides, amines).
   - Add hydrophobic or non-polar groups to reduce solubility and drug-like properties.
3. **Action**:
   - Replace the amide group (`NC(=O)`) with a less polar or more complex group (e.g., ester, ether, or a bulky alkyl chain).
   - This change reduces polarity and introduces a less drug-like feature, thereby decreasing QED.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with an ester group (OC(=O)) to reduce polarity and introduce a less drug-like feature."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and polar surface area. To lower QED, we can consider the following strategies:

1. **Increase molecular weight or logP**: Adding bulky or hydrophobic groups can decrease QED.
2. **Add or remove polar groups**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can lower QED.
3. **Introduce less common functional groups**: Groups that are less common in drugs can decrease drug-likeness.

Given the structure of the root molecule, we can focus on modifying the functional groups or adding non-polar groups to decrease QED. Here’s the reasoning for the suggested action:

- **Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) with a less polar group**: This can decrease the number of hydrogen bond acceptors and reduce QED.
- **Add a bulky non-polar group**: This can increase the molecular weight and logP, both of which can decrease QED.
- **Replace the amine group (NH) with a less polar group**: This can reduce hydrogen bond donors, lowering QED.

Based on this reasoning, the top suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) attached to the nitrogen atom with a methylene group (CH2)."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-like properties. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, and the number of aromatic rings. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. **Increase Molecular Weight:** Adding bulky groups or atoms can increase molecular weight and reduce QED.
2. **Increase LogP:** Introducing hydrophobic groups can increase logP, making the molecule less drug-like.
3. **Reduce Hydrogen Bond Donors or Acceptors:** Removing or modifying groups that can form hydrogen bonds can decrease QED.
4. **Increase Polar Surface Area:** Adding polar groups can increase the polar surface area, which can reduce QED if it becomes too large.
5. **Introduce Steric Hindrance:** Adding groups that create steric hindrance can reduce the drug-like properties.

Given the root molecule, we can target specific functional groups or atoms for modification while keeping the overall structure similar. The suggestions below aim to achieve these goals.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the root molecule, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-like properties. Common strategies to achieve this include:

1. **Introducing less favorable functional groups**: Adding groups like nitro or bulky substituents can decrease QED.
2. **Increasing molecular weight or hydrophobicity**: Adding large hydrophobic groups can reduce drug-likeness.
3. **Disrupting favorable interactions**: Removing or modifying hydrogen bond donors/acceptors can lower QED.
4. **Introducing steric hindrance**: Adding bulky groups can reduce drug-likeness by making the molecule less likely to bind to targets.

Given the structure of the root molecule (CCc1ccc([C@@H](COC)NC(=O)N[C@H]2CCCC[C@@H]2C)o1), we can target specific functional groups or atoms for modification. Based on these considerations, here is the reasoning process:

1. **Replace the amide group (NC=O) with a less favorable functional group**: The amide group contributes to drug-likeness. Replacing it with a less favorable group like a nitro group or an ester can decrease QED.
2. **Add a bulky substituent to the aromatic ring**: Adding a bulky group like a tert-butyl or a phenyl group can decrease QED.
3. **Replace the ether group (COC) with a less favorable group**: The ether group contributes to drug-likeness. Replacing it with a less favorable group like a thioether or a bulky alkyl group can decrease QED.
4. **Introduce a nitro group**: Nitro groups are generally unfavorable in drug-like molecules and can significantly lower QED.
5. **Add a large hydrophobic group**: Adding a long alkyl chain or a polyaromatic group can decrease drug-likeness.

After evaluating these options, the most effective modification to achieve the desired QED decrease while maintaining structural similarity is to **replace the amide group (NC=O) with a nitro group**.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC=O) with a nitro group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the molecule `root_molecule` to decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
   
2. **Current QED**: The QED of `root_molecule` is 0.3260672592835578. The target QED after modification should be less than or equal to 0.2260672592835578.

3. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that generally reduce drug-likeness. This can be achieved by:
   - Adding bulky or polar groups that are less common in drug-like molecules.
   - Removing or replacing functional groups that contribute positively to drug-likeness.
   - Introducing steric hindrance or reducing solubility.

4. **Structural Similarity**: To maintain similarity, modifications should target peripheral or less critical parts of the molecule rather than the core structure.

5. **Action Space**: Based on the structure of `root_molecule`, we can consider:
   - Adding a large hydrophobic group (e.g., a phenyl ring) to reduce solubility.
   - Replacing a hydrogen atom with a bulky group (e.g., a tert-butyl group).
   - Introducing a polar group (e.g., a nitro group) that is less favorable for drug-likeness.

6. **Final Decision**: The most effective way to decrease QED while maintaining similarity is to **add a phenyl ring** to a position that increases steric hindrance and reduces solubility.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a phenyl ring to the nitrogen atom of the amide group attached to the thiophene ring."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

1. **Objective**: Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Strategy**: 
   - The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can introduce changes that negatively impact these properties.
   - Structural similarity can be maintained by modifying functional groups or atoms in a way that doesn’t drastically alter the core scaffold of the molecule.
3. **Action Space**: 
   - Add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups.
4. **Considerations**:
   - To decrease QED, we can introduce bulky or polar groups, reduce aromaticity, or disrupt hydrogen bonding patterns.
   - The modifications should not significantly alter the core structure to maintain similarity.

### Suggested Modification

We can replace one of the nitrogen atoms in the imidazole-like ring with a sulfur atom. This change introduces a less favorable heteroatom, which can decrease the QED by disrupting the hydrogen bonding potential and slightly increasing molecular weight.

### Final Suggestion

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one nitrogen atom in the imidazole-like ring with a sulfur atom to disrupt hydrogen bonding and decrease QED."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

1. **Goal**: To make the molecule less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule.

2. **Analysis of the Root Molecule**:
   - The root molecule (COc1ccc(CN(C)C(=O)[C@@H]2CCO[C@@H]2C)cc1F) contains a methoxy group (CO), a fluorine atom (F), and a chiral center with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a nitrogen atom (N) in a cyclic structure.
   - The QED of the root molecule is 0.849, so the target QED for the modified molecule should be ≤ 0.749.

3. **Possible Modifications**:
   - To decrease QED, we can introduce less drug-like features, such as bulkier or less functionalized groups, or remove polar groups that contribute to drug-likeness.
   - Replacing the methoxy group with a bulkier, less polar group (like an ethyl group) could reduce QED.
   - Replacing the fluorine atom with a larger halogen (like bromine) could also decrease QED.
   - Modifying the carbonyl group to a less polar or less drug-like functional group (like a methylene group) could further reduce QED.

4. **Selection of Top Suggestion**:
   - Replacing the methoxy group with an ethyl group is likely to decrease QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion

final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group with an ethyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

The goal is to modify the molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, polarity, and the presence of functional groups. To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as adding bulky groups, increasing hydrophobicity, or reducing polarity.

Here are some potential strategies to achieve this:

1. **Add a bulky hydrophobic group**: Introducing a large hydrophobic group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) can decrease QED by increasing molecular weight and lipophilicity.
2. **Replace a polar group with a non-polar group**: Substituting a polar group (e.g., an amide) with a non-polar group (e.g., an alkyl chain) can reduce polarity and decrease QED.
3. **Introduce steric hindrance**: Adding a group that creates steric hindrance can decrease drug-likeness.
4. **Remove a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor**: Removing or modifying a group that participates in hydrogen bonding can reduce QED.
5. **Increase the number of rotatable bonds**: Adding flexible chains or rings can decrease drug-likeness.

Based on these strategies, the most effective and straightforward modification is to add a bulky hydrophobic group, such as a tert-butyl group, to the molecule. This modification will increase hydrophobicity and molecular weight, effectively decreasing QED without drastically altering the overall structure.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a tert-butyl group to the benzene ring attached to the nitrogen atom."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the structure in a way that reduces its drug-likeness while maintaining some similarity to the original molecule. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Drug-likeness and QED**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To decrease QED, we can introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, adding bulky groups, or reducing polarity.

2. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modified molecule should still resemble the original molecule structurally. This can be achieved by making conservative changes, such as altering side chains or replacing functional groups with less drug-like alternatives.

3. **Action Space**: Based on the action space, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. To decrease QED, we should focus on adding bulky or non-polar groups, or replacing polar groups with less polar ones.

4. **Suggestion**: A good option is to replace the methoxy group (which is relatively polar and contributes to drug-likeness) with a larger, less polar group, such as a tert-butyl group. This change will increase the molecular weight and reduce polarity, thereby decreasing QED.

Here’s the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group attached to the benzene ring with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the molecule `Cc1nc2ccccn2c1-c1nnc([S-])o1` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should still be similar to the original structure.

2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.595. To decrease QED by at least 0.1, the new molecules should have a QED of less than or equal to 0.495. QED is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To reduce QED, we should make the molecule bulkier, more hydrophobic, or introduce groups that increase complexity or reduce solubility.

3. **Modification Strategy**:
   - **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding bulky groups or larger substituents can decrease QED.
   - **Introduce Hydrophobic Groups**: Hydrophobic groups like aromatic rings or alkyl chains can reduce QED.
   - **Reduce Hydrogen Bond Acceptors/Donors**: Removing or replacing polar groups can decrease QED.

4. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

5. **Action Space**: We will focus on **adding** or **replacing** functional groups to achieve the desired QED reduction.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfur atom in the thione group with a larger, non-polar aromatic ring such as a phenyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we need to consider modifications that introduce features that are less drug-like. Drug-likeness is often associated with specific properties such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and the presence of certain functional groups. To decrease QED, we can introduce less favorable features such as increased hydrophobicity, bulky groups, or removing favorable hydrogen-bonding groups.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Increase Hydrophobicity**: Adding hydrophobic groups or increasing the size of existing hydrophobic groups can decrease QED.
2. **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Bulky groups can disrupt the drug-likeness by increasing steric hindrance.
3. **Remove Favorable Functional Groups**: Removing groups that contribute to hydrogen bonding or other favorable interactions can decrease QED.
4. **Modify Aromatic Systems**: Disrupting aromatic systems or introducing less favorable aromatic groups can decrease QED.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Replace the fluorine atom with a more hydrophobic and bulky group**: Fluorine is a small, electronegative atom that can contribute to hydrogen bonding and polarity. Replacing it with a larger, more hydrophobic group such as a chlorine atom or a methyl group can decrease QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluorine atom on the benzene ring with a chlorine atom."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that would reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. This can be achieved by altering its physicochemical properties, such as increasing hydrophobicity, reducing hydrogen bonding potential, or introducing steric hindrance. 

Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Hydrophobicity**: Increasing the hydrophobicity of the molecule can decrease its drug-likeness. This can be done by adding non-polar groups or removing polar groups.
2. **Hydrogen Bonding**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED. For example, replacing an amide group with an ester group reduces hydrogen bonding potential.
3. **Steric Hindrance**: Introducing bulky groups can decrease drug-likeness by making the molecule less likely to bind to biological targets.

Based on these considerations, the following modification is suggested to decrease the QED while maintaining some similarity to the original molecule:

**Replace the amide group with an ester group**.

This modification reduces the hydrogen bonding potential and slightly increases the hydrophobicity, which should decrease the QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while keeping structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **QED Consideration**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) decreases with structural changes that reduce drug-like properties. This can be achieved by altering key functional groups or introducing less favorable groups.
3. **Structural Similarity**: To maintain similarity, modifications should focus on subtle changes, such as replacing or altering functional groups rather than making drastic structural changes.
4. **Previous Experience**: Based on drug design principles, replacing polar or ionizable groups with non-polar groups often reduces QED.
5. **Action Space**: The task allows for adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups. Replacing the ammonium group (`[NH2+]`), amide group (`N(C)C`), or heterocyclic nitrogen (`cnn`) with less polar groups could achieve the goal.

### Final Suggestions:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ammonium group with a methyl group."]
``` 

This modification reduces polarity and removes a charged group, which is likely to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that would reduce drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Drug-likeness and QED**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors like molecular weight, lipophilicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. Reducing drug-likeness can be achieved by introducing less favorable properties, such as increasing molecular weight, reducing polarity, or adding bulky groups.

2. **Structural similarity**: To maintain similarity to the original molecule, we should focus on small, localized changes rather than large-scale modifications.

3. **Previous experience**: From previous experience, changing functional groups or adding/removing atoms in a way that disrupts the molecular structure can effectively reduce QED.

### Reasoning for the suggested modification:
- **Adding a bulky group**: Adding a bulky group like a phenyl ring or a long alkyl chain can decrease drug-likeness by increasing molecular weight and reducing solubility.
- **Replacing a polar group**: Replacing a polar group like an amide or hydroxyl with a less polar group (e.g., an alkyl group) can reduce QED.
- **Introducing a steric hindrance**: Adding a group that introduces steric hindrance can disrupt the molecule's ability to interact with biological targets, reducing its drug-like properties.

### Final suggestion:
Based on these considerations, the optimal modification to decrease QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity is to add a phenyl ring to the nitrogen atom in the molecule, which will introduce steric hindrance and increase molecular weight.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a phenyl ring to the nitrogen atom in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's approach this step-by-step:

**Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** We need to modify the molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The current QED is 0.915, so the target QED should be ≤ 0.815.

2. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less drug-like. Common strategies include:
   - Adding bulky or hydrophobic groups, which can decrease solubility and drug-likeness.
   - Introducing groups that increase molecular weight or LogP.
   - Removing polar groups or hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, which are generally favorable in drugs.

3. **Target Modification:** The molecule contains a thiazole ring, a phenyl group, and an amide linkage. Introducing a bulky, hydrophobic group on the phenyl ring or the thiazole ring would likely decrease QED while retaining similarity.

4. **Similarity Consideration:** To maintain similarity, modifications should be limited to peripheral groups rather than altering the core structure (e.g., the thiazole or phenyl ring).

5. **Previous Experience:** Based on prior knowledge, adding large alkyl or aryl groups to aromatic rings has effectively reduced QED in similar molecules.

6. **Action:** Replace a hydrogen atom on the phenyl ring with a tert-butyl group. This bulky, hydrophobic group will increase LogP and molecular weight, reducing QED significantly.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the phenyl ring with a tert-butyl group."]
```

2. **QED Consideration**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that make the molecule less drug-like, such as adding bulky groups, increasing hydrophobicity, or reducing hydrogen bonding potential.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. To achieve this, we need to make changes that negatively impact drug-likeness, such as:
- Adding bulky groups that reduce solubility or permeability.
- Introducing hydrophobic or non-polar groups that decrease the molecule's balance of properties.
- Removing or replacing functional groups that contribute to favorable drug-like properties.

The QED of the root molecule is 0.7731797087858384, so the target QED after modification should be ≤ 0.6731797087858384.

To maintain similarity, the modifications should be minimal and focused on specific functional groups or atoms in the molecule.

### Suggested Modification:
Replace the hydroxyl group on the chiral carbon with a methyl group. This change will reduce the molecule's polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, which decreases its drug-likeness. Additionally, the introduction of a hydrophobic methyl group will likely lower the QED score.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the chiral carbon with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule `CSc1nnc2n(N)cnn12` by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-like properties. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors, hydrogen bond acceptors, and polar surface area. To lower the QED, we can increase the molecular weight, introduce polar groups, or reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding a bulky group can decrease QED. However, this should be done carefully to maintain similarity.
2. **Introduce Polar Groups**: Adding polar groups like hydroxyl or carboxyl groups can increase logP and decrease QED.
3. **Reduce Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Removing or replacing nitrogen atoms (which are hydrogen bond acceptors) with non-polar atoms or groups can decrease QED.
4. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule.

### Suggested Modification:
Replace a nitrogen atom in the ring with a carbon atom to reduce the number of hydrogen bond acceptors, which will decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the nitrogen atoms in the ring with a carbon atom to reduce the number of hydrogen bond acceptors and decrease QED."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the given molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce modifications that reduce the drug-like properties. Drug-like properties are often enhanced by the presence of polar groups, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and specific functional groups. To reduce QED, we can reduce polarity, hydrogen bonding, or introduce bulky groups that disrupt the molecule's drug-likeness.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Reduce Hydrogen Bonding**: Removing or replacing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors will decrease the QED. For example, replacing an amide group with a less polar group like an ester or ether can help.
2. **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Adding bulky groups like alkyl chains can disrupt the molecule's ability to interact with biological targets, thereby reducing QED.
3. **Replace Polar Groups**: Replacing polar groups like carbonyls with non-polar groups such as alkyl or aryl groups can decrease QED.
4. **Remove Functional Groups**: Deleting functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness, such as amides or sulfides, can reduce QED.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the reasoning above, the top suggestion is to replace the amide group (SCC(=O)N) with an ester group (SCC(=O)O), which reduces hydrogen bonding potential and slightly decreases polarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (SCC(=O)N) with an ester group (SCC(=O)O)."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.1 while keeping it similar to the root molecule, we need to identify modifications that will reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. 

Here’s the reasoning process:
1. **Hydrophobicity**: Increasing hydrophobicity by adding non-polar groups or removing polar groups can decrease QED.
2. **Molecular Weight**: Increasing molecular weight beyond the optimal range can reduce QED.
3. **Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can lower QED.
4. **Polar Surface Area**: Decreasing polar surface area can reduce QED.

Given the structure of the root molecule, one effective way to achieve this is by replacing a polar group (like the amide group) with a less polar group or by adding a bulky non-polar group.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (CC(=O)N) with a non-polar alkyl group (e.g., CC(C)C)"]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. This can be achieved by introducing functional groups or structural changes that are less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as adding non-polar or bulky groups, or removing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups.

Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify the polar and hydrogen-bonding groups** in the root molecule: The hydroxyl group, amide groups (NC(=O)), and the carbonyl group (C=O) are key polar groups that contribute to the molecule's drug-likeness.

2. **Modify these groups** to reduce their polarity or hydrogen-bonding potential, which will decrease the QED:
   - Replace the hydroxyl group with a less polar group.
   - Modify the amide groups to less polar functional groups.
   - Reduce the polarity of the carbonyl group.

3. **Ensure the modifications** do not drastically change the overall structure to maintain similarity to the root molecule.

Considering these points, the top-1 suggestion is:

**Replace the hydroxyl group with a methyl group.**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of `root_molecule` by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to identify modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) score is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, logP, the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and the presence of certain functional groups. Modifications that increase molecular weight, introduce polar or bulky groups, or disrupt the balance of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors can lower the QED score.

Here’s the reasoning process:
1. **Increase molecular complexity**: Adding a bulky or polar group can decrease QED.
2. **Disrupt hydrogen bonding**: Introducing a group that increases the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors beyond the optimal range for drug-likeness.
3. **Increase hydrophobicity**: Adding non-polar groups can increase logP, which may lower QED.
4. **Introduce less drug-like functional groups**: Adding groups like nitro, sulfone, or long alkyl chains can reduce QED.

Based on these considerations, here’s a modification that can achieve the goal:

**Replace the fluorine atoms on the benzene ring with nitro groups.**
- Nitro groups are less drug-like compared to fluorine due to their larger size, higher polarity, and potential for metabolic instability.
- This modification should decrease the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: Let's think through the problem step by step:

**Goal**: Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The QED of the root molecule is 0.8168074365499173, so the modified molecule's QED should be below 0.7168074365499173.

**Approach**:
1. **Understanding QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness)**: QED is influenced by molecular properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, polar surface area, and rotatable bonds. To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, altering logP, or adding groups that disrupt drug-like properties.
2. **Similarity Constraints**: The modified molecule should retain structural similarity to the root molecule. This means we should focus on small, localized changes rather than large-scale alterations.
3. **Modification Strategy**:
   - Introduce bulky or polar groups that disrupt drug-like properties.
   - Replace functional groups with less drug-like alternatives.
   - Add groups that increase molecular weight or logP excessively.

**Specific Suggestions**:
1. Replace the cyano group (C#N) on the benzene ring with a nitro group, which is bulkier and more polar.
2. Replace the fluorine atom on the benzene ring with a bromine atom, which is bulkier and increases molecular weight.
3. Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) with a sulfonyl group (SO2), which is bulkier and less drug-like.
4. Replace the N-methyl group with an N-ethyl group, increasing molecular weight and logP.
5. Add a hydroxyl group to the benzene ring with the cyano group, increasing polarity and disrupting drug-like properties.

**Selected Suggestion**: Replace the cyano group (C#N) on the benzene ring with a nitro group. This change introduces a bulky and polar group, which decreases drug-likeness and reduces QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the cyano group on the benzene ring with a nitro group."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal Understanding:** The task is to modify the given molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The QED of the root molecule is 0.572, so the target QED after modification should be less than 0.472.

2. **QED Considerations:** QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by molecular properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we should modify the molecule to increase molecular complexity or introduce less drug-like features.

3. **Structural Similarity:** The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity. This means targeting peripheral functional groups or adding/removing atoms/groups that do not drastically alter the core scaffold.

4. **Modification Strategy:** Based on the structure of the root molecule, we can focus on the following modifications:
   - Replace a polar group (e.g., carbonyl group) with a non-polar group.
   - Add a bulky substituent to increase steric hindrance.
   - Introduce a less common functional group that decreases drug-likeness.

5. **Specific Suggestions:** The modification should target functional groups that are likely to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group on the pyrrole ring with a methyl group"]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 and make it less drug-like while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-like properties. Key strategies include:

1. **Adding or increasing hydrophobicity**: Drug-like molecules often have balanced hydrophobicity. Increasing hydrophobicity can reduce QED.
2. **Introducing bulky or non-drug-like groups**: Adding large, non-polar groups or groups that disrupt molecular symmetry can decrease QED.
3. **Reducing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors**: Drug-like molecules typically have a certain number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Reducing these can lower QED.
4. **Introducing non-polar or less polar functional groups**: Replacing polar groups with non-polar ones can reduce drug-likeness.

Based on these strategies, the following modification is suggested to achieve the goal while maintaining structural similarity:

**final_suggestion**: Replace the hydrogen atom on the nitrogen atom in the amide group with a tert-butyl group to introduce bulkiness and reduce polarity.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **Current QED**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.835. We need to reduce it to below 0.735.

3. **Strategies**:
   - **Add bulky groups**: Introducing bulky groups can decrease drug-likeness by increasing molecular weight and complexity.
   - **Remove or replace polar functional groups**: Reducing polarity can decrease QED by making the molecule less drug-like.
   - **Introduce less common functional groups**: Adding groups like nitro or sulfur-containing groups can decrease drug-likeness.
   - **Increase hydrophobicity**: Making the molecule more hydrophobic can reduce QED.

4. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

5. **Suggested Modification**: Replace the amide group (`-C(=O)N-`) with a less polar and bulkier group like a thiocarbonyl (`-C(=S)-`) or introduce a nitro group (`-NO2`) to decrease polarity and drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a thiocarbonyl group to decrease polarity and increase bulkiness."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **Analysis of the Root Molecule**:
   - The molecule contains several functional groups: a ketone, an amide, a tertiary alcohol, and an aromatic ring with an amide substituent.
   - The QED of the root molecule is 0.687715558425451, so the target QED after modification should be less than 0.587715558425451.

3. **Strategies to Decrease QED**:
   - **Increase Molecular Complexity**: Adding bulky groups or increasing the number of atoms can decrease QED.
   - **Introduce Less Drug-like Features**: For example, adding non-polar or bulky groups, or removing polar functional groups.
   - **Introduce Steric Hindrance**: Adding groups that introduce steric hindrance can reduce drug-likeness.

4. **Specific Modifications**:
   - **Add a bulky group**: Introducing a bulky group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) to the aromatic ring can decrease QED.
   - **Remove a polar group**: Removing a polar group like the hydroxyl group can decrease QED.
   - **Replace a polar group with a non-polar group**: Replacing the hydroxyl group with a methyl group can decrease QED.
   - **Introduce a double bond**: Adding a double bond to the aliphatic chain can decrease QED.
   - **Add a halogen**: Introducing a chlorine atom to the aromatic ring can decrease QED.

5. **Choosing the Best Modification**:
   - The most effective modification to decrease QED while maintaining similarity is to **replace the hydroxyl group with a non-polar group** like a methyl group.
   - This change reduces polarity and increases molecular weight, both of which contribute to a decrease in QED.

1. **Goal**: Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.704. We need to reduce it to below 0.604.
3. **Strategy**: 
   - **Decrease drug-likeness**: This can be achieved by introducing less favorable features, such as bulky groups, or removing favorable features like hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.
   - **Maintain similarity**: Modifications should be minimal and focused on functional groups or atoms that do not drastically alter the core structure.
4. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.
5. **Considerations**: Avoid repeating previous suggestions, and ensure modifications are described fully without abbreviations.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties of the molecule. This can be achieved by introducing functional groups or atoms that are less common in drug molecules or by altering the structure in a way that reduces its overall drug-likeness. Here are some potential modifications and reasoning:

1. **Add a hydroxyl group to the nitrogen in the pyridine ring**: Hydroxyl groups are polar and can disrupt the molecule's lipophilicity, reducing its drug-likeness.

2. **Replace the chlorine atoms with fluorine atoms**: Fluorine is more electronegative and can change the electronic properties of the molecule, potentially reducing its drug-likeness.

3. **Add a nitro group to the benzene ring**: Nitro groups are highly polar and can significantly decrease the QED by disrupting the molecule's overall properties.

4. **Replace the methoxy group with an ethyl group**: Increasing the size of the alkyl group can reduce the molecule's drug-likeness by increasing its hydrophobicity.

5. **Add a sulfonamide group to the nitrogen in the pyridine ring**: Sulfonamide groups are bulky and polar, which can decrease the QED significantly.

Based on these considerations, the top-1 suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the benzene ring"]
```

This modification is expected to introduce significant polarity to the molecule, thereby reducing its drug-likeness and significantly decreasing the QED.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

The goal is to modify the root molecule to decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. To achieve this, we need to make changes that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. Here are the steps I followed:

1. **Identify Key Functional Groups:** The root molecule contains a sulfonyl group, a carbonyl group, and several fluorine atoms. These groups contribute to its drug-like properties.

2. **Strategies to Decrease QED:**
   - **Adding bulky groups:** Adding bulky groups can decrease QED by making the molecule less drug-like.
   - **Removing polar groups:** Reducing polarity can decrease QED since many drugs have polar functional groups.
   - **Introducing less common functional groups:** Introducing groups that are less common in drugs can lower QED.

3. **Maintaining Similarity:** The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure to maintain similarity to the root molecule.

4. **Action Space:** Based on the action space, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups.

5. **Previous Experience:** Considering previous experiences, replacing or adding specific bulky or less common functional groups has been effective in decreasing QED.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonyl group with a thioether group."]
```

This suggestion focuses on modifying a key functional group (sulfonyl) that contributes significantly to the drug-likeness of the molecule. Replacing it with a thioether group should decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
   
2. **Current QED**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.767, so the target QED after modification should be ≤ 0.667.

3. **Strategy**: To reduce QED, we can introduce features that are less favorable in drug molecules, such as:
   - Adding bulky or non-polar groups.
   - Replacing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups with non-polar ones.
   - Increasing molecular weight or complexity in ways that deviate from drug-like properties.

4. **Structural Considerations**: The root molecule contains a bicyclic structure with amide groups and an aromatic ring. To maintain similarity, we should avoid drastic changes to the core structure.

5. **Suggested Modification**: 
   - Replace one of the hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring (phenyl group) with a large, non-polar group like a tert-butyl group. This will increase molecular weight and reduce polarity, thereby decreasing QED while maintaining similarity to the root molecule.

6. **Final Suggestion**: Replace a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring with a tert-butyl group.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1 while keeping the molecule similar to the root molecule, we can focus on introducing modifications that increase molecular complexity, reduce solubility, or introduce less drug-like features. Here are the key considerations:

1. **Introduce bulky or non-polar groups**: Adding large, non-polar groups can decrease QED by reducing solubility and increasing molecular complexity.
2. **Remove polar or hydrogen-bonding groups**: Removing groups like amides or sulfonamides can reduce drug-likeness.
3. **Introduce less common functional groups**: Groups like nitro can decrease QED due to their non-drug-like nature.

Given the root molecule contains a sulfonamide, amide, and nitro groups, we can target these for modification. Here’s the reasoning for the suggested action:

- **Replace the sulfonamide group with a less polar and bulkier group**: This will decrease solubility and QED while maintaining some similarity to the root molecule.

The final suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonamide group with a phenyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: Let’s break this down step-by-step:

### Goal:
We need to modify the input molecule (root_molecule) to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should remain structurally similar to the input molecule.

### Guidelines:
1. **QED Decrease:** The new molecules must have a QED decrease of at least 0.1 compared to the root molecule (QED = 0.861).
2. **Structural Similarity:** The modifications should not drastically alter the structure of the molecule. The output should still resemble the input molecule.
3. **Chemical Modifications:** We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups but should avoid using abbreviations (e.g., "hydroxyl group" instead of "OH").
4. **Non-Repetition:** The suggestions should not repeat previous modifications.

### Reasoning:
To decrease QED and make the molecule less drug-like, we should introduce changes that reduce favorable drug-like properties (e.g., hydrogen bonding, polar surface area, logP, molecular weight, etc.). Here are some strategies:
1. **Remove or Replace Polar Functional Groups:** Replacing or removing groups like hydroxyl, amine, or carbonyl groups will reduce hydrogen bonding and polarity, decreasing QED.
2. **Introduce Bulky or Non-Polar Groups:** Adding non-polar or bulky groups (e.g., alkyl chains) can decrease solubility and increase hydrophobicity, reducing QED.
3. **Disrupt Aromaticity:** Modifying aromatic rings (e.g., adding substituents) can disrupt favorable drug-like properties.
4. **Increase Molecular Weight or LogP:** Adding large or hydrophobic groups can increase molecular weight or logP, reducing QED.

### Top Suggestion:
Based on the structure of the input molecule, the **most effective change** would be to **replace the carbonyl group (C=O) in the five-membered ring with a non-polar group** (e.g., a methyl group). This reduces hydrogen bonding potential and polarity, significantly decreasing QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the five-membered ring with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1 while retaining similarity to the root molecule, we need to make strategic modifications. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by molecular properties such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups. To decrease QED, we can:

1. **Increase molecular weight or complexity**: Adding larger or more complex groups.
2. **Introduce less drug-like features**: Adding polar or bulky groups that are less common in drugs.
3. **Disrupt aromaticity**: Modifying aromatic rings to reduce planarity.

Given the structure of the root molecule, which contains aromatic rings, nitrogen atoms, and fluorine atoms, we can target substituents on the aromatic rings or modify the nitrogen-containing groups. Here are five modifications that could achieve the goal:

```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace a fluorine atom on the benzene ring with a nitro group."
]
```

This suggestion targets the fluorine atoms, which are common in drug molecules, and replaces them with a nitro group, which is less common in drugs and can decrease QED by increasing polarity and molecular weight. This modification also retains the overall structure and similarity to the root molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** Modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1. The QED of the root molecule is 0.5946893931341846, so the target QED after modification should be less than 0.4946893931341846.

2. **Approach:** To achieve this, we need to make structural changes that typically decrease drug-likeness. This can include:
   - Adding or introducing bulky or polar groups that may hinder absorption or bioavailability.
   - Removing or altering functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness (e.g., hydrogen bond donors/acceptors).
   - Introducing groups that increase molecular weight or hydrophobicity, which generally decrease QED.

3. **Considerations:**
   - The modifications should retain some structural similarity to the original molecule.
   - The changes should be significant enough to impact QED but not so drastic as to completely alter the molecule's core structure.
   - Avoid repeating previous suggestions.

4. **Proposed Modification:** Introduce a long hydrophobic alkyl chain to the molecule. This will increase the molecular weight and hydrophobicity, which is likely to decrease the QED.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group with a long hydrophobic alkyl chain (e.g., octyl group) at the terminal carbon of the ethoxy group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the root molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Drug-likeness and QED**: Drug-likeness is often associated with properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and the presence of certain functional groups. Reducing QED can be achieved by altering these properties, such as increasing molecular weight, adding hydrophobic groups, or introducing less common functional groups.

2. **Structural Similarity**: To maintain similarity, modifications should focus on side chains or peripheral groups rather than altering the core structure.

3. **Functional Group Changes**: Introducing bulky or less polar groups can decrease QED. For example, replacing a carbonyl group with a larger, less polar group or adding hydrophobic substituents can reduce drug-likeness.

4. **Retention of Key Features**: The core structure, including the ring systems and key functional groups, should remain largely unchanged to ensure similarity.

Based on this reasoning, the following modification is suggested:

- **Replace the carbonyl group in the ester functionality with a less polar and bulkier group, such as a thiocarbonyl group**.

This change increases the molecular weight and reduces polarity, which should decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the ester functionality with a less polar and bulkier group, such as a thiocarbonyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while keeping the molecule structurally similar, we need to make modifications that reduce drug-likeness. This can be achieved by:

1. **Adding bulky or non-drug-like groups**: Introducing larger or less common functional groups that are not typically found in drugs can decrease QED.
2. **Removing essential drug-like features**: Eliminating polar groups or hydrogen bond donors/acceptors can reduce drug-likeness.
3. **Introducing steric hindrance**: Adding groups that create steric hindrance can decrease QED by making the molecule less likely to interact with biological targets.

Given the root molecule, a good strategy would be to introduce a bulky group or replace a functional group with a less drug-like alternative. Here’s the reasoning for the top suggestion:

- **Replace the methyl group (C) attached to the nitrogen with a bulky tert-butyl group**: This addition will introduce steric hindrance and reduce drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methyl group attached to the nitrogen with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

1. **Objective**: Modify the molecule to reduce its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To reduce QED, we can:
   - Increase molecular weight or logP.
   - Reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.
   - Introduce less polar or bulky groups.

3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule, such as the benzene rings and the amide linkage.

4. **Suggested Modifications**:
   - Replace the hydroxyl group in the `NCCO` fragment with a less polar group like a methyl group.
   - Add a bulky hydrophobic group to the phenyl ring.
   - Substitute the amide nitrogen with a less polar group like an alkyl group.

5. **Final Selection**: The most effective change to reduce QED while maintaining similarity is to **replace the hydroxyl group in the `NCCO` fragment with a methyl group**. This reduces hydrogen bonding capacity and increases hydrophobicity.

### Final Suggestion

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group in the NCCO fragment with a methyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: Modify the root molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, polar surface area, and other factors. To decrease QED, we can:
   - Increase hydrophobicity (e.g., by adding non-polar groups).
   - Increase molecular weight (e.g., by adding bulky groups).
   - Reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (e.g., by removing polar groups).
3. **Structural Similarity**: To maintain similarity, we should avoid drastic changes and focus on modifying peripheral functional groups or adding/replacing atoms in less critical regions.
4. **Action Space**: Based on the molecule's structure, we can modify the ethyl ether group (`OCC`), the amino group (`[NH2+]`), or the aromatic ring system.

2. **QED Reduction Strategy:** To reduce QED, we can introduce features that are less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as incorporating more complex or bulky groups, reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or increasing molecular weight.

3. **Structural Similarity:** To maintain similarity, the modifications should be localized and not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while keeping the molecule structurally similar, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-likeness without drastically altering the core structure. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Reasoning for QED Reduction**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, polar surface area, and rotatable bonds. To decrease QED, we can:
   - Increase molecular weight or logP.
   - Add bulky or non-polar groups.
   - Introduce functional groups that reduce hydrogen bonding potential.

2. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should be subtle to maintain similarity to the root molecule. For example, we can replace or modify functional groups without altering the core scaffold significantly.

3. **Suggested Modifications**:
   - Replace the fluorine atom with a larger halogen like bromine or a non-polar group like a methyl group.
   - Add a bulky group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) to the aromatic ring or the aliphatic chain.
   - Replace the carbonyl group with a less polar functional group like an ether or a thioether.
   - Introduce a non-polar substituent (e.g., an isopropyl group) on the nitrogen atom.

4. **Final Suggestion**: Based on the above reasoning, the most effective modification to achieve the goal while maintaining similarity is to replace the fluorine atom with a bromine atom. This will increase molecular weight and logP, reducing QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluorine atom on the aromatic ring with a bromine atom."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** We need to modify `root_molecule` to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The QED of `root_molecule` is currently 0.7886124565725747, so the target QED should be ≤ 0.6886124565725747.

2. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we can make the molecule less drug-like by introducing features that reduce its desirability as a drug, such as:
   - Adding bulky or hydrophobic groups.
   - Removing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups.
   - Introducing less common or less favorable functional groups.
   - Reducing the molecule's solubility or increasing its molecular weight.

3. **Action Space:** Based on the molecule's structure, we can focus on modifying the amine group (`[NH2+]`), the amide group (`CC(=O)NC`), or the hydrophobic side chains (`CC(C)(C)C` and `C[C@H](CC)`).

4. **Similarity Consideration:** The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

5. **Final Suggestion:** Based on the reasoning above, the most effective change would be to replace the polar amine group with a less polar or bulkier group, as this would significantly decrease QED while keeping the molecule similar to the original structure.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amine group [NH2+] with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity, the following reasoning process is applied:

### Reasoning Process:
1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and polar surface area. To reduce QED, we can:
   - Increase hydrophobicity by adding non-polar groups.
   - Introduce bulky or non-drug-like functional groups.
   - Reduce hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.

2. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule, such as the bicyclic system and the key heterocycles.

3. **Specific Modifications**:
   - Replace the carbonyl group (=O) in the lactam ring with a less polar group.
   - Add a bulky alkyl group to the nitrogen atoms to disrupt drug-like properties.
   - Replace a nitrogen atom in the heterocycle with a carbon atom to reduce hydrogen bonding potential.

4. **Previous Experience**: Avoid repeating previous suggestions and focus on functional group replacements that are impactful yet maintain the overall scaffold.

5. **Final Suggestion**: Based on the above, the most effective modification is to **replace the carbonyl group in the lactam ring with a methylene group**.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: Modify the root_molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.
2. **Approach**: To reduce QED, we can introduce less drug-like features such as:
   - Adding bulky or less polar groups.
   - Removing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness.
   - Introducing steric hindrance or less favorable interactions.
3. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should be minimal to maintain structural similarity, focusing on small functional group changes or substitutions.
4. **Action Space**: Since we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups, we will focus on replacing atoms or groups with less drug-like alternatives.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) in the amide with a less polar group**, such as a methylene group (CH2), to decrease the drug-likeness of the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to consider modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. Generally, drug-like molecules have certain characteristics, such as balanced hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding capacity, and molecular weight. To reduce QED, we can:

1. **Increase hydrophobicity** by removing polar groups or adding non-polar groups.
2. **Increase molecular weight** by adding bulky substituents.
3. **Disrupt hydrogen bonding** by removing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors or introducing steric hindrance.

Given the root molecule `CC(C)(CO[N+](=O)[O-])C(=O)Cl`, the nitro group (`[N+](=O)[O-]`) and the carbonyl chloride (`C(=O)Cl`) are polar and contribute to drug-likeness. Removing or replacing these groups with less polar or bulkier groups could decrease QED.

### Reasoning Process:
- **Modify the nitro group**: Replacing the nitro group with a non-polar or bulky group can reduce polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity.
- **Modify the carbonyl chloride**: Replacing the carbonyl chloride with a less polar or bulkier group can also reduce drug-likeness.
- **Add bulky substituents**: Adding bulky groups to the molecule can increase molecular weight and reduce drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the above reasoning, the best suggestion to decrease QED while maintaining similarity is to **replace the nitro group with a tert-butyl group**. This modification increases hydrophobicity and bulkiness, reducing drug-likeness without drastically altering the core structure.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we can consider the following reasoning steps:

1. **QED Considerations**: The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and polar surface area. Decreasing QED typically involves introducing features that reduce drug-likeness, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or introducing steric hindrance.

2. **Structural Similarity**: We should focus on modifying parts of the molecule that are not critical to its core structure. For example, modifying substituents or functional groups on the aromatic rings or altering side chains.

3. **Molecule-Specific Modifications**: The root molecule has several functional groups (e.g., amide, thiophene, fluorine-substituted aromatic ring) that can be modified to reduce QED. Introducing bulky groups or polar groups in these positions can help.

4. **Previous Experience**: From previous experience, replacing hydrogen atoms with more polar or bulky groups often decreases QED. For example, adding hydroxyl groups or replacing hydrogen atoms with halogens can reduce drug-likeness.

Based on these considerations, here is a suggested modification that meets the criteria:

**Replace the fluorine atom on the aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group.**

This modification introduces a more polar group, which can decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluorine atom on the aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: To modify the `root_molecule` to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 (current QED: 0.778) while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by physicochemical properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, etc. To decrease QED, we can introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding bulky groups, or altering hydrogen bonding patterns.
3. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity is preserved.
4. **Modification Suggestions**:
   - **Add a bulky hydrophobic group**: This can increase molecular weight and logP, reducing QED.
   - **Replace a hydrogen bond donor/ acceptor**: Modify groups that contribute to hydrogen bonding to reduce polarity.
   - **Introduce a polar group in a hydrophobic region**: Disrupting molecular polarity can decrease QED.
   - **Replace a small group with a larger one**: This can increase steric hindrance and reduce drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydrogen atom on the secondary amine group (NH) with a tert-butyl group to increase hydrophobicity and steric hindrance."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the given molecule by at least **0.1** while maintaining structural similarity, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness. Here’s the reasoning and approach:

1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: 
   - The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by molecular properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To reduce QED, we can introduce features that are less favorable for drug-likeness, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or introducing steric hindrance.

2. **Structural Similarity**:
   - Since the goal is to maintain similarity to the original molecule, modifications should focus on small, localized changes rather than large-scale alterations.

3. **Suggested Modifications**:
   - Introduce a polar group (e.g., hydroxyl group) to increase polarity and reduce drug-likeness.
   - Add a bulky substituent to increase steric hindrance and reduce QED.
   - Replace a hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom to increase hydrophobicity, which can reduce QED.

4. **Action Selection**:
   - Adding a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring (e.g., replacing a hydrogen on the phenyl ring with a hydroxyl group) is a reasonable choice because it increases polarity and reduces drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity.

5. **Final Suggestion**:
   - Add a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring (replacing a hydrogen atom) to increase polarity and reduce QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to the phenyl ring (replacing a hydrogen atom)."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The task is to modify the `root_molecule` to decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule. The current QED is 0.793, so the new QED should be below 0.693.

2. **Analyzing the Molecule**: The `root_molecule` contains several functional groups including a fluorine atom, an amide group, a cyclic amine, and a pyrimidine ring. Modifying these groups can impact the QED.

3. **Strategies to Decrease QED**:
   - **Hydrophobicity**: Increasing hydrophobicity (e.g., adding aromatic rings or alkyl chains) tends to decrease QED.
   - **Polarity**: Reducing polarity (e.g., removing polar groups like amides or amines) can lower QED.
   - **Molecular Weight**: Increasing molecular weight (e.g., adding bulky groups) can decrease QED.

4. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule, ensuring it remains similar to the original molecule.

5. **Proposed Modification**:
   - **Replace the Amide Group**: The amide group is polar and contributes to drug-likeness. Replacing it with a more hydrophobic group (e.g., an ester or an ether) could decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **QED Reduction Goal**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.685, and we need to reduce it by at least 0.1 to bring it below 0.585. This requires making structural changes that decrease the drug-likeness of the molecule, such as introducing less favorable functional groups or increasing molecular complexity in unfavorable ways.

2. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should still keep the molecule reasonably similar to the root molecule in terms of core structure.

3. **Action Space**: We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. To reduce QED, we should consider introducing bulky or polar groups, breaking symmetry, or adding less desirable features like halogens or large alkyl chains.

4. **Specific Modifications**:
   - **Adding a hydroxyl group**: Introducing a polar hydroxyl group can decrease QED by increasing polarity and decreasing drug-likeness.
   - **Replacing a hydrogen with a chlorine atom**: Chlorine is a halogen that can reduce QED due to its size and electronegativity.
   - **Adding a carboxyl group**: Carboxyl groups are polar and can decrease drug-likeness.
   - **Breaking symmetry**: Introducing asymmetry can reduce QED by making the molecule less drug-like.
   - **Adding a large alkyl chain**: Long alkyl chains can decrease drug-likeness by increasing hydrophobicity and molecular weight.

5. **Optimal Suggestion**: **Adding a carboxyl group** to the molecule is a strong candidate because it significantly increases polarity and decreases drug-likeness, while also maintaining some structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a carboxyl group to the aromatic ring."]

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task and reasoning step-by-step to achieve the goal of modifying the root molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Understanding the Root Molecule**:
   - The root molecule `C[C@@H]([NH2+]C1CCCCCC1)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1` contains a cyclohexyl ring attached to an ammonium group, a phenyl ring with a nitro group, and a chiral center with a methyl group.
   - The QED of the root molecule is **0.5155514591462095**.

2. **QED Reduction Strategy**:
   - QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is a metric that considers properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, polarity, and presence of certain functional groups. To reduce QED, we need to introduce features that make the molecule less drug-like (e.g., increasing hydrophobicity, adding large substituents, or introducing polar groups).

3. **Maintaining Similarity**:
   - The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity. Therefore, changes should focus on substituents or minor functional group alterations.

4. **Action Space**:
   - Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.

5. **Previous Experience**:
   - Ensure the suggestion does not repeat previous modifications.

6. **Final Decision**:
   - A logical modification would be to **replace the nitro group with a more polar and less drug-like group, such as a sulfate group**, which increases hydrophilicity and decreases QED. This retains the structure's aromaticity and chiral center while reducing drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group on the phenyl ring with a sulfate group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: We need to modify the given molecule (`root_molecule`) to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The new molecules should remain structurally similar to the original molecule.

2. **Analyzing the Molecule**: The `root_molecule` contains several functional groups and motifs that contribute to its drug-like properties, such as the nitro group, amide group, and aromatic rings. We need to alter these groups in a way that reduces the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

3. **Previous Experience**: From previous attempts, replacing or removing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness (e.g., nitro group, amide group) has been effective in reducing QED.

4. **Suggestion Strategy**: Given the structure, replacing the nitro group (`[N+](=O)[O-]`) with a less polar or less complex group could reduce QED significantly. For example, replacing it with a hydroxyl group or a methyl group would decrease the molecule's polarity and complexity, thus reducing its QED.

5. **Similarity Consideration**: Replacing the nitro group with a smaller, less polar group should maintain structural similarity while effectively reducing QED.

6. **Final Suggestion**: Replace the nitro group (`[N+](=O)[O-]`) with a hydroxyl group.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the given molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining its structural similarity, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-like properties. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and polar surface area. To lower the QED, we can:

1. **Increase hydrophobicity**: Adding non-polar groups or removing polar groups can decrease the QED.
2. **Increase molecular weight**: Adding bulky groups can reduce drug-likeness.
3. **Reduce hydrogen bonding potential**: Removing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can lower the QED.
4. **Introduce steric hindrance**: Adding bulky groups or replacing small groups with larger ones can decrease the QED.

Given these strategies, the most effective way to decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity would be to modify functional groups that contribute to drug-like properties.

### Reasoning:
- The molecule contains an amide group (C(N)=O), which is a polar and drug-like feature. Replacing this with a less polar group (e.g., an alkyl group) would decrease the QED.
- The amino group ([NH2+]) is a strong hydrogen bond donor. Replacing it with a non-polar group (e.g., a methyl group) would reduce hydrogen bonding potential and decrease the QED.
- The sulfone group (S(=O)(=O)) is polar and contributes to drug-likeness. Replacing it with a less polar group (e.g., a thioether) would decrease the QED.

### Top Suggestion:
- **Replace the amide group (C(N)=O) with a methyl group (C) on the cyclopentane ring to reduce polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (C(N)=O) with a methyl group (C) on the cyclopentane ring to reduce polarity and hydrogen bonding potential."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the root molecule, we need to focus on modifying functional groups or atoms that have a significant impact on drug-likeness and QED. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify key functional groups**: The molecule contains methoxy groups (`COc`), an amide group (`C(=O)N`), and a piperidine-like structure (`C3CCC4`). These groups are often associated with drug-like properties.

2. **Modify to reduce drug-likeness**: 
   - Methoxy groups are common in drugs, so replacing them with less drug-like groups (e.g., alkyl groups) can reduce QED.
   - The amide group is highly polar and often used in drugs, so replacing it with a less polar group (e.g., an ester or ether) could decrease QED.

3. **Maintain similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure to maintain similarity.

4. **Avoid repeating previous suggestions**: Ensure the modification is unique and not previously suggested.

5. **Prioritize functional group changes**: Functional groups have a more significant impact on QED than single atoms.

**Final Suggestion**:
- Replace one of the methoxy groups with a methyl group to reduce the polarity and drug-likeness.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the methoxy groups with a methyl group to reduce the polarity and drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify `root_molecule` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while keeping the modified molecule similar to the original structure.

2. **QED Consideration:** To decrease QED, we should introduce less drug-like features such as nonpolar groups, steric hindrance, or less common functional groups in drug molecules.

3. **Structural Similarity:** The modifications should retain the core structure of `root_molecule` to ensure similarity. The molecule has a phenyl ring, an alkyne group, an amide group, and a charged amine with hydroxyl groups.

4. **Action Space:** We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups while considering the guidelines.

5. **Suggested Modification:** Adding a bulky nonpolar group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) to the phenyl ring would decrease QED by increasing steric hindrance and reducing drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a tert-butyl group to the phenyl ring of the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we need to make strategic modifications that reduce drug-likeness. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, presence of certain functional groups, and polarity. To decrease QED, we can:

1. Increase molecular weight or hydrophobicity by adding bulky or non-polar groups.
2. Introduce functional groups that are less common in drugs, such as nitro groups or long aliphatic chains.
3. Reduce polarity or hydrogen bonding potential by removing polar groups or replacing them with less polar ones.

Given the structure of the root molecule, we can modify functional groups or add/remove atoms in a way that disrupts its drug-like properties while keeping the overall structure similar.

**Reasoning Process**:
- The root molecule contains a piperidine ring, an amide group, and an aromatic system with an ether linkage.
- To decrease QED, we can modify the piperidine ring or the amide group, as these are critical for drug-likeness.
- Introducing a bulky group or replacing a polar group with a less polar one can decrease QED.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a nitro group on the piperidine ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original structure, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can:

1. **Increase hydrophobicity**: Adding hydrophobic groups or removing polar groups can decrease QED.
2. **Disrupt hydrogen bonding**: Removing or replacing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can reduce QED.
3. **Increase molecular weight**: Adding bulky groups can decrease QED, but this should be done cautiously to maintain similarity.
4. **Introduce steric hindrance**: Adding bulky groups can disrupt the molecule’s overall drug-like properties.

Given the structure of the root molecule, we can target specific functional groups or atoms for modification. For example:

- The sulfonyl group (`S(=O)(=O)`) is a polar group that contributes to the molecule's drug-likeness. Replacing it with a less polar group could decrease QED.
- The amide group (`NC(=O)`) is a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. Modifying this group could reduce QED.
- The aromatic ring (`c2ccccc2`) could be altered to reduce polarity or introduce steric hindrance.

Considering these points, the most effective change would be to replace the sulfonyl group with a less polar or more hydrophobic group. This will decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

Here is the top suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonyl group with a methyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: Decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The current QED is 0.695, so the target QED after modification should be less than 0.595.

2. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that are less drug-like, such as:
   - Adding large or bulky groups that decrease solubility or increase molecular weight.
   - Introducing less common functional groups that are less favorable in drug-like molecules.
   - Removing or modifying polar groups that contribute to drug-likeness.

3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

4. **Action Space**: We will focus on replacing or adding functional groups that are less drug-like but do not significantly alter the core structure.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a nitro group (NO2) on the benzene ring attached to the thiophene."]
```

This modification introduces a nitro group, which is less common in drug-like molecules and typically decreases QED by reducing solubility and increasing molecular weight. The structural similarity is maintained as the core framework of the molecule remains intact.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **QED Reduction Strategy:** To reduce QED, we can introduce features that decrease drug-likeness, such as:
   - Increasing molecular weight.
   - Adding polar or hydrophobic groups.
   - Introducing steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions.

3. **Similarity Consideration:** The modifications should target specific functional groups or atoms to ensure the new molecules remain structurally similar to the original.

4. **Avoiding Repetition:** The suggestions should not repeat previous modifications.

5. **Targeted Modifications:** Based on the root molecule's structure, potential modifications include:
   - Altering the amide group.
   - Modifying the aromatic ring.
   - Changing the alkyl chain.

6. **Proposed Action:** Replace the amide group with a less drug-like functional group, such as an ester or a ketone, which is less favorable in drug-like molecules.

**final_suggestion:**
```python
["Replace the amide group (C(=O)N) in the root molecule with a ketone group (C=O) to decrease drug-likeness and reduce QED."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the given molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce changes that reduce drug-likeness. Drug-likeness is often associated with features like hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, molecular weight, polarity, and lipophilicity. To reduce QED, we can consider adding or modifying functional groups that make the molecule less drug-like (e.g., increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or reducing hydrogen bonding potential).

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Reduce Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Removing or replacing groups capable of hydrogen bonding (e.g., hydroxyl, amine) can decrease QED.
2. **Increase Molecular Weight**: Introducing bulky groups can reduce QED.
3. **Introduce Polar Groups**: Adding polar but non-drug-like groups (e.g., nitro) can decrease QED.
4. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule.

### Suggestion:
Replace the amide group in the molecule with a less polar and less hydrogen-bonding functional group, such as an ester. This reduces hydrogen bonding potential and slightly increases molecular weight, thereby decreasing QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group to reduce hydrogen bonding potential and increase molecular weight."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Given the task, the goal is to modify the root molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The root molecule has a QED of 0.863, and the threshold for QED decrease is 0.1. To achieve this, we need to make changes that likely reduce drug-likeness, such as adding bulky groups, introducing polar groups, or disrupting aromaticity. However, we must ensure the modifications keep the molecule similar to the root structure.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: To decrease QED, we can:
   - Add polar or bulky groups that reduce drug-likeness.
   - Replace or delete aromatic rings or functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness.
   - Introduce less favorable structural elements like larger aliphatic chains or polar heteroatoms.

2. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. The key is to retain the scaffold while introducing changes that lower QED.

3. **Avoid Repeating Previous Suggestions**: The modifications should be unique and not replicate prior suggestions.

4. **Specificity**: The suggestions should explicitly describe the changes without using abbreviations.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group on the benzene ring with a nitro group."]
```

This suggestion introduces a polar nitro group, which is likely to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce drug-like properties. This can be achieved by introducing or modifying functional groups that are less common in drugs or by increasing molecular complexity in a way that reduces drug-likeness.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Introducing Bulky Groups**: Adding bulky groups can decrease QED by increasing molecular weight and reducing solubility, both of which are unfavorable for drug-likeness.
2. **Removing Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED, as these are important for drug-like properties.
3. **Adding Polar Groups**: Introducing polar groups like nitro or sulfonate can decrease QED by making the molecule more polar and less drug-like.
4. **Increasing Aromaticity**: Adding aromatic rings can decrease QED by increasing the complexity and reducing solubility.
5. **Introducing Steric Hindrance**: Adding sterically hindered groups can decrease QED by making the molecule less likely to interact with biological targets.

Based on these strategies, the following modification is suggested:

- **Replace the nitro group with a sulfonate group**: This increases polarity and reduces drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a sulfonate group on the aromatic ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To address the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to consider modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. The Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, and the number of rotatable bonds. To decrease QED, we should focus on modifications that introduce unfavorable characteristics for drug-likeness, such as increasing molecular weight, introducing polar groups, or adding rotatable bonds.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. We should focus on changes to functional groups or substituents rather than altering the backbone.
2. **Decrease QED**: The changes should reduce the QED by at least 0.1. This can be achieved by:
   - Introducing polar or charged groups that increase hydrophilicity.
   - Adding bulkier groups that increase molecular weight or reduce solubility.
   - Increasing the number of rotatable bonds or hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

3. **Avoid Repeating Previous Suggestions**: Ensure that the suggested modifications are unique and not previously suggested.

### Proposed Modifications:
1. **Replace a hydrogen atom with a hydroxyl group**: This increases the polarity and hydrophilicity, which can decrease QED.
2. **Replace the fluorine atoms with chlorine atoms**: Chlorine is bulkier and less electronegative than fluorine, which can reduce drug-likeness.
3. **Add a methyl group to the aromatic ring**: This increases molecular weight and can introduce steric hindrance.
4. **Replace the carbonyl group with a sulfonyl group**: Sulfonyl groups are bulkier and more polar, which can decrease QED.
5. **Add a methoxy group to the aromatic ring**: This increases molecular weight and introduces an additional rotatable bond.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the reasoning, the top suggestion to achieve the goal is to **replace a hydrogen atom with a hydroxyl group**, as it is a straightforward modification that increases polarity and hydrophilicity, thereby decreasing QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace a hydrogen atom with a hydroxyl group"]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **QED Considerations**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can modify the molecule to increase molecular weight, increase hydrophobicity (logP), or introduce less drug-like features.
3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.
4. **Potential Modifications**:
   - **Add a bulky hydrophobic group**: Increasing hydrophobicity can decrease QED.
   - **Replace a polar group with a hydrophobic group**: This reduces drug-likeness.
   - **Remove a polar group**: This also reduces drug-likeness.
5. **Strategy**: Add a bulky hydrophobic group (such as a phenyl ring) to the molecule to increase hydrophobicity and disrupt drug-likeness.

AI Suggestion 0: Reasoning Process:
1. **QED Reduction Goal**: The current QED of the molecule is 0.8558, and we need to reduce it by at least 0.1, targeting a QED below 0.7558.
2. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule, ensuring that the new molecules remain similar to the original.
3. **Functional Group Impact**: Removing or altering polar functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups, aromatic rings) or introducing hydrophobic groups can decrease QED.
4. **Experience from Previous Modifications**: Replacing or deleting functional groups that contribute to polarity or drug-likeness can effectively reduce QED.
5. **Action Space**: Focus on replacing or deleting atoms or functional groups that contribute to high QED, such as polar groups or aromatic rings.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Replace the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring with a hydrogen atom**. This change reduces the polarity of the molecule, decreasing its QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring with a hydrogen atom."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we need to consider modifications that reduce the drug-likeness without drastically altering the core structure of the molecule.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as hydrophobicity, molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can:
   - Increase hydrophobicity by adding non-polar groups.
   - Increase molecular weight by adding bulky groups.
   - Reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors by modifying or removing polar groups.
   
2. **Similarity Preservation**: To maintain similarity, we should avoid altering the core structure significantly. Instead, we can focus on modifying peripheral groups.

3. **Previous Experience**: From previous suggestions, we know that adding or replacing functional groups at specific positions can influence QED without drastically changing the overall structure.

### Suggested Modification:
To reduce QED by at least 0.1, we can replace the hydroxyl group on the cyclohexane ring with a more hydrophobic group, such as a methyl group. This modification will reduce the hydrogen bond donor/acceptor count and increase hydrophobicity, thereby decreasing QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the cyclohexane ring with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Understanding the Goal:** The task is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should retain structural similarity to the root molecule.

2. **Analyzing the Root Molecule:** The root molecule contains functional groups such as esters, amides, and aromatic rings. These features contribute to its drug-likeness. To decrease the QED, we need to introduce less desirable features or remove favorable ones.

3. **Strategic Modifications:**
   - **Adding Bulky Groups:** Introducing bulky or hydrophobic groups can decrease QED by making the molecule less soluble or less bioavailable.
   - **Removing Favorable Groups:** Removing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups like amides or esters can reduce QED.
   - **Introducing Unfavorable Groups:** Adding groups that are not typically found in drugs (e.g., nitro groups) can decrease QED.

4. **Ensuring Similarity:** To maintain similarity, modifications should be localized to specific parts of the molecule rather than altering the core structure.

5. **Learning from Previous Experience:** Since no previous suggestions are provided, we focus on logical modifications that align with the goal.

**Final Suggestion:**

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that reduce the drug-like properties. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To decrease QED, we can:

1. **Increase molecular weight or hydrophobicity**: Adding larger hydrophobic groups or removing polar groups can decrease QED.
2. **Introduce unfavorable functional groups**: Adding groups like nitro or sulfone, which are less common in drugs, can lower QED.
3. **Disrupt key drug-like features**: Modifying or removing functional groups like amides, esters, or rings that are common in drugs can reduce QED.

Given the structure of the root molecule (`Cc1occc1C(=O)N1CCC[C@@H]1C(N)=O`), which contains a lactam ring, an amide, and an aromatic ring, we can target these regions for modification.

**Reasoning Process:**

1. **Modify the amide group**: Replacing the amide with a less drug-like group, such as an ester or nitrile, could decrease QED.
2. **Add a bulky hydrophobic group**: Adding a bulky group like a phenyl or cyclohexyl to the aromatic ring could increase hydrophobicity and decrease QED.
3. **Replace the lactam ring**: Modifying the lactam ring to a non-cyclic structure or introducing a less favorable ring system could reduce drug-likeness.
4. **Introduce a nitro group**: Adding a nitro group to the aromatic ring is a straightforward way to decrease QED.
5. **Remove a polar group**: Removing the carbonyl group from the lactam ring could reduce polarity and decrease QED.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a nitrile group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To address the goal of modifying the root molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we can consider the following reasoning steps:

1. **Understanding QED**: The Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, solubility, and the presence of functional groups. To decrease QED, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as adding bulky or less polar groups, or disrupting favorable interactions.

2. **Structural Similarity**: To maintain similarity, we should focus on minor changes, such as altering functional groups or adding small moieties, rather than making large structural changes.

3. **Previous Experience**: Based on previous modifications, changing functional groups (e.g., replacing an amide with an ester) or adding bulky groups (e.g., adding a phenyl ring) have been effective in decreasing QED.

4. **Action Space**: Since we are limited to adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups, we will focus on replacing or adding groups that disrupt favorable interactions or increase molecular bulk.

**Rationale for the suggested modification**:
- Replace the amide group (`NC(=O)`) with a less polar ester group (`OC(=O)`). This change will reduce the molecule's drug-likeness, as esters are generally less favorable in drug design compared to amides. This modification is expected to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while keeping the molecule similar to the original structure. The QED of the root molecule is currently 0.879, so the target QED should be below 0.779.

2. **Analyzing the Molecule**: The root molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that contribute to its drug-like properties, such as amide bonds, aromatic rings, a nitrile group, and a chlorine atom. To decrease QED, we need to introduce less drug-like features or disrupt favorable drug-like properties.

3. **Approach**:
   - **Introducing Bulkier Groups**: Adding bulkier groups can decrease QED by making the molecule less soluble or more sterically hindered.
   - **Removing Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED.
   - **Introducing Non-Aromatic Rings**: Replacing aromatic rings with non-aromatic groups can decrease QED.
   - **Adding Hydrophobic Groups**: Introducing more hydrophobic groups can decrease solubility and QED.

4. **Strategy for Similarity**: To maintain similarity, modifications should be made to parts of the molecule that are less critical to its overall structure, such as the side chains or substituents on the aromatic ring.

5. **Final Suggestion**: Based on the above reasoning, the top suggestion is to replace the nitrile group (C#N) with a bulkier and less polar group, such as a tert-butyl group. This change will decrease QED by introducing steric hindrance and reducing polarity, while maintaining the overall structure of the molecule.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitrile group with a tert-butyl group on the aromatic ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: Modify the given molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The new molecules should still be structurally similar to the original molecule.

2. **Current QED**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.7499414094533571. We need to reduce it to below 0.6499414094533571.

3. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we can introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like, such as:
   - Adding bulky or non-drug-like functional groups.
   - Removing or modifying key pharmacophoric features.
   - Introducing more complex or less favorable chemical groups.

4. **Action Space**: We will focus on replacing or adding atoms or functional groups that make the molecule less drug-like while maintaining structural similarity.

5. **Modification Suggestion**: 
   - Replace the ester group (C(=O)O) with a less drug-like group, such as a nitro group (NO2), which is less common in drugs and will decrease QED.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **QED Reduction Goal:** The current QED of the molecule is 0.844, and we need to decrease it by at least 0.1. QED is influenced by properties like molecular weight, lipophilicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To reduce QED, we can make the molecule less drug-like by increasing molecular complexity, adding bulky groups, or introducing polar or charged groups.

2. **Molecular Similarity:** The modified molecule should retain structural similarity to the original molecule. This means that the core structure (e.g., the cyclohexane ring, phenyl ring, and amino group) should remain intact, but modifications can be made to substituents or side chains.

3. **Functional Group Modifications:** Adding or replacing functional groups with less drug-like features (e.g., large hydrophobic groups, charged groups, or bulky substituents) can help reduce QED.

4. **Avoiding Previous Suggestions:** We need to ensure that the suggested modifications are novel and have not been suggested before.

5. **Specificity:** The suggestion should be clear and specific, avoiding abbreviations and focusing on detailed structural changes.

**Final Suggestion:**

final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the side chain with a sulfonic acid group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule (`Cc1cc(C)c(S(=O)(=O)Nc2ccc(O)c3ccccc23)c(C)c1`) by at least 0.1, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-like properties. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, and the number of rotatable bonds. To achieve this, we can perform modifications that increase molecular complexity, reduce solubility, or introduce unfavorable functional groups.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Remove the hydroxyl group**: The hydroxyl group contributes to hydrogen bonding and solubility, which are favorable for drug-likeness. Removing it will decrease the QED.
2. **Replace the sulfonamide group with a more hydrophobic group**: The sulfonamide group is polar and contributes to hydrogen bonding. Replacing it with a less polar group will reduce the QED.
3. **Introduce a bulky, hydrophobic substituent**: Adding a bulky group (e.g., a phenyl group) can increase molecular weight and logP, decreasing the QED.
4. **Increase the number of rotatable bonds**: Adding flexible chains can decrease the QED by increasing the number of rotatable bonds.
5. **Introduce a charged group**: For example, an ammonium group would decrease the QED due to its unfavorable properties in drug-likeness.

Given that the molecule should remain similar to the root molecule, the most straightforward modification is to remove the hydroxyl group. This change will reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors and lower the polar surface area, both of which will decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Remove the hydroxyl group from the benzene ring attached to the sulfonamide nitrogen."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we can consider the following reasoning steps:

1. **Identify functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness**: Common drug-like features include hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, aromatic rings, and specific functional groups like amides, sulfides, and imines. Modifying or removing these can reduce drug-likeness.

2. **Target modifications that reduce QED**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. Increasing molecular weight, logP, or introducing bulky groups can decrease QED.

3. **Maintain structural similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. Preferably, changes should be made to peripheral groups or substituents.

Based on these considerations, the top-1 suggestion is:

**final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a bulkier ester group to reduce drug-likeness and increase molecular weight, thereby decreasing QED."]**

This modification retains the core structure while introducing a less drug-like functional group, which should effectively reduce the QED.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-like properties. Possible strategies include:

1. **Adding bulky or non-polar groups**: This can disrupt the molecule's drug-likeness by increasing its molecular weight or decreasing its solubility.
2. **Removing or replacing polar groups**: Polar groups like amides, ethers, or hydroxyl groups contribute to drug-likeness. Removing or replacing them with non-polar groups can decrease QED.
3. **Adding or replacing with aromatic rings**: Aromatic rings can increase the molecule's complexity and decrease its drug-likeness.
4. **Introducing steric hindrance**: Adding groups that create steric hindrance can reduce the molecule's ability to interact with biological targets, thus decreasing QED.

Based on the root molecule structure and the goal of maintaining similarity while decreasing QED, the most effective strategy would be to **replace a polar functional group with a non-polar or bulky group**.

**Reasoning**:
- The root molecule contains an amide group (`C(=O)N`), which is a polar and drug-like feature.
- Replacing the nitrogen in the amide group with a carbon atom or a bulky group (e.g., a phenyl ring) would decrease the molecule's polarity and drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitrogen atom in the amide group with a carbon atom to reduce polarity and drug-likeness."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule while maintaining structural similarity. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and topological polar surface area (TPSA). To decrease QED, we can:

1. Increase molecular weight or logP.
2. Introduce bulky or non-polar groups that disrupt hydrogen bonding or increase hydrophobicity.
3. Replace polar groups with non-polar groups.

Given the structure of the root molecule (CSc1cccc(NC(=O)C[C@H]2C[C@H]3CC[C@@H]2C3)c1), we can focus on modifying functional groups or adding non-polar substituents.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a non-polar group** like an alkyl chain to decrease polarity and disrupt hydrogen bonding.
2. **Add a bulky hydrophobic group** to the aromatic ring to increase logP and molecular weight.
3. **Replace the sulfur atom (S)** with a less polar atom like carbon to reduce polarity.
4. **Introduce a halogen** (e.g., chlorine or bromine) to increase molecular weight and logP.
5. **Add a methyl group or larger alkyl group** to the cyclohexane ring to increase hydrophobicity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a propyl group to decrease polarity and disrupt hydrogen bonding."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while keeping the modified molecule structurally similar to the original.

2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.556. To decrease it by at least 0.1, the new QED should be ≤ 0.456.

3. **Modification Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like. Common strategies include adding bulky groups, reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or increasing lipophilicity.

4. **Structural Similarity**: The modified molecule should retain the core structure of the root molecule, so we focus on peripheral modifications.

5. **Suggested Modifications**:
   - Adding a bulky alkyl chain to the nitrogen in the amide group.
   - Replacing the sulfone group with a less polar functional group.
   - Adding a hydrophobic group to the aromatic ring system.
   - Introducing a sterically hindering group near the chiral center.
   - Reducing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors by modifying the carbonyl group.

6. **Top Suggestion**: The most effective way to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity is to **add a bulky alkyl chain to the nitrogen in the amide group**, as it increases molecular weight and lipophilicity without drastically altering the core structure.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a bulky alkyl chain to the nitrogen in the amide group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the root molecule, the following reasoning process is applied:

1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To reduce QED, we can introduce features that are less drug-like, such as increasing hydrophobicity, increasing molecular weight beyond typical drug-like ranges, or reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

2. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the root molecule to ensure similarity. This means avoiding drastic changes to the scaffold or functional groups directly involved in the molecule's primary structure.

3. **Functional Group Modifications**: Adding or replacing functional groups with less drug-like properties (e.g., bulky hydrophobic groups) can effectively reduce QED.

4. **Avoiding Repetition**: The suggestions should not repeat previous modifications from the $previous prompt.

Based on this reasoning, the top-1 suggestion is:

**Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) on the benzene ring with a tricyclohexyl group.**

This modification increases molecular weight and hydrophobicity, significantly reducing QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group on the benzene ring with a tricyclohexyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while keeping the molecule similar to the original, we need to introduce modifications that reduce drug-likeness. QED is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and the number of rotatable bonds. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Add bulky or hydrophobic groups**: Introducing large or hydrophobic groups can decrease QED by increasing logP and molecular weight.
2. **Remove polar groups**: Removing polar groups like hydroxyl or ether groups can reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, decreasing QED.
3. **Introduce non-drug-like features**: Adding non-aromatic rings or non-planar structures can reduce drug-likeness.
4. **Increase rotatable bonds**: Adding flexible chains or rotatable bonds can decrease QED.

Based on this reasoning, the top suggestion is to add a bulky hydrophobic group to the molecule, which will increase logP and molecular weight, reducing the QED significantly while maintaining some similarity to the root molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the root molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that reduce drug-likeness. Drug-likeness is often influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and the presence of functional groups that are typically found in drugs. To decrease QED, we can introduce changes that make the molecule less favorable according to the QED criteria, such as increasing molecular weight, introducing polar or charged groups, or reducing aromaticity.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Add a polar group**: Introducing a highly polar group like a sulfonic acid group can decrease QED by making the molecule less drug-like.
2. **Increase molecular weight**: Adding a large functional group like a tert-butyl group can increase molecular weight and reduce drug-likeness.
3. **Introduce a charged group**: Adding a quaternary ammonium group can significantly decrease QED due to the introduction of a permanent positive charge.
4. **Replace an aromatic ring with a non-aromatic structure**: Removing aromaticity from the molecule can reduce drug-likeness and decrease QED.
5. **Introduce steric hindrance**: Adding bulkier groups like a phenyl group can introduce steric hindrance and reduce drug-likeness.

Based on these considerations, the top suggestion is to **introduce a quaternary ammonium group**, as it will significantly decrease QED by introducing a permanent positive charge, which is generally unfavorable in drug-like molecules.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Introduce a quaternary ammonium group to the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the given molecule by at least 0.1 and make it less like a drug, while keeping the molecule similar to the input, we need to modify functional groups or atoms in a way that reduces drug-like properties. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and the presence of certain functional groups. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify key functional groups**: The input molecule contains a carboxyl group (CO), an aromatic ring with a bromine substituent, and a tertiary amine group (N(C)C). These groups contribute to its drug-likeness.

2. **Modify to reduce drug-likeness**:
   - Replace the bromine atom with a less drug-like substituent, such as a bulky or polar group.
   - Replace the methyl groups on the tertiary amine with less common or bulkier groups.
   - Replace the carboxyl group with a less polar or less common functional group.

3. **Ensure similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

### Suggestion:
Replace one of the methyl groups on the tertiary amine with a larger and less common alkyl group, such as an ethyl group. This change will increase steric bulk and decrease drug-likeness while keeping the molecule structurally similar.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the methyl groups on the tertiary amine with an ethyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity, I will consider the following steps:

1. **Identify functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness**: The molecule contains amide groups, an aromatic ring, and an ether linkage. These are common in drug molecules. Modifying these groups could reduce drug-likeness.

2. **Reduce polarity or hydrogen bonding**: Amide groups contribute to hydrogen bonding, which is a key feature in drug molecules. Replacing or modifying these groups could decrease QED.

3. **Introduce less common functional groups**: Adding or replacing with less common functional groups in drug molecules could reduce drug-likeness.

4. **Maintain structural similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity to the original molecule.

Based on these considerations, the following modification could be effective:

- **Replace one of the amide groups with an ester group**: This reduces hydrogen bonding potential and introduces a less common functional group in drug molecules.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the amide groups with an ester group"]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** Modify the root molecule to resemble a drug less and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original structure.
2. **Current QED:** 0.6386, so the target QED should be ≤ 0.5386.
3. **Key Considerations:**
   - QED can be decreased by introducing less drug-like features, such as polar or bulky groups, or disrupting aromaticity.
   - Modifications should preserve the core scaffold to maintain similarity to the root molecule.
   - Avoid excessive changes that would drastically alter the molecule's identity.
4. **Proposed Strategy:** 
   - Add or replace functional groups that reduce QED, such as hydroxyl groups, nitro groups, or larger substituents.
   - Avoid introducing highly drug-like features like halogens or small alkyl groups.

**Final Suggestion:**

final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydrogen atom on the nitrogen in the imidazole ring with a hydroxyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the given molecule (`COc1ccc(NC(=O)Cn2nc(C)c(N)c2C)cn1`) to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The QED of the root molecule is 0.8716, so the target QED after modification should be less than or equal to 0.7716.

2. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we need to make the molecule less drug-like. This can be achieved by:
   - Introducing less favorable functional groups (e.g., bulky groups, groups that decrease solubility or increase molecular complexity).
   - Reducing hydrogen bonding capabilities.
   - Increasing molecular weight or steric hindrance in a way that decreases drug-likeness.

3. **Structural Considerations:** The molecule contains an amide group (`NC(=O)`), an aromatic ring, and a heterocycle with nitrogen atoms. To maintain similarity, modifications should focus on these regions without drastically altering the core structure.

4. **Action Plan:** Replace the amide group (`NC(=O)`) with a less favorable functional group, such as a sulfonamide (`NS(=O)`), which is bulkier and less optimal for drug-likeness. This modification is expected to decrease QED while keeping the molecule structurally similar.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a sulfonamide group (NS(=O))."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) score is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, logP, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, and the number of rotatable bonds. To decrease QED, we can consider the following strategies:

1. **Increase molecular weight**: Adding larger functional groups or atoms can decrease QED.
2. **Increase hydrophobicity**: Adding non-polar groups can increase logP, which tends to decrease QED.
3. **Increase the number of rotatable bonds**: Introducing flexibility can decrease QED.
4. **Reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors**: Removing or replacing polar groups can decrease QED.
5. **Introduce steric hindrance**: Adding bulky groups can reduce drug-likeness.

Given the molecule `CCc1nc2n(n1)CCC[C@@H]2NC(=O)c1cnc(C)cn1`, we can make modifications that fit these strategies.

### Reasoning Process:
- **Replace the amide group (NC=O) with a less polar group**: The amide group is polar and contributes to drug-likeness. Replacing it with a non-polar group like an alkyl chain could decrease QED.
- **Add a bulky group to the nitrogen in the pyrazole ring**: Adding a bulky group like a tert-butyl group can increase steric hindrance and reduce drug-likeness.
- **Increase the number of rotatable bonds**: Inserting a flexible linker, such as an ethylene glycol chain, can increase flexibility and decrease QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC=O) with a non-polar alkyl chain, such as a propyl group, to reduce polarity and decrease QED."]
```

This suggestion aims to maintain structural similarity while reducing drug-likeness by decreasing polarity, which directly impacts the QED score.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original structure, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. Here’s a step-by-step reasoning process:

1. **Identify Functional Groups Affecting Drug-Likeness**: The molecule contains several functional groups (e.g., carbonyl, ether, ester, and aromatic rings) that contribute to its drug-like properties. Modifying these groups can reduce the QED.

2. **Modify Polar Groups**: Reducing polarity can decrease QED. For example, replacing a polar group like a carbonyl group with a non-polar group (e.g., a methyl group) can be effective.

3. **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Adding bulky substituents can reduce drug-likeness by making the molecule less likely to fit into drug-binding pockets.

4. **Remove Solubility-Enhancing Groups**: Groups like ethers or esters that enhance solubility can be replaced with less soluble alternatives to decrease QED.

5. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should be localized to specific functional groups to ensure the molecule remains similar to the original structure.

Based on this reasoning, here’s the top-1 suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) on the benzene ring with a methyl group to decrease polarity and disrupt drug-likeness."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Objective**: The goal is to modify the molecule `O=C(CNC(=O)c1csc2c1CCCC2)c1cccs1` to make it less drug-like and reduce its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1. The QED of the root molecule is 0.881, so the target QED should be less than 0.781.

2. **Analyzing the Molecule**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with a thiophene group and one with a benzene ring), an amide group, a ketone group, and a thioether group. To reduce QED, we need to introduce features that are less common in drug-like molecules, such as increasing molecular weight, adding bulky groups, or decreasing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

3. **Possible Modifications**:
   - **Increase Steric Bulk**: Adding a bulky group can decrease QED by making the molecule less drug-like.
   - **Remove Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Reducing the number of these groups can lower QED.
   - **Add Polar Groups**: Introducing polar groups that are less common in drugs (e.g., nitro groups) can decrease QED.

4. **Prioritizing Similarity**: The modified molecule should retain structural similarity to the original molecule, so substantial changes like adding large aliphatic chains or completely altering the core structure are avoided.

5. **Top Suggestion**: Based on the analysis, the best approach is to **add a bulky group** to one of the aromatic rings, which will reduce QED while maintaining similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a tert-butyl group to the benzene ring of the molecule."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule \( \text{Nc1nc(Cc2nc3ccc(Br)cc3s2)cs1} \) to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
   
2. **QED Consideration**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.7813, so the target QED after modification should be less than or equal to 0.6813.

3. **Strategies for Decreasing QED**:
    - **Increase molecular weight**: Larger molecules tend to have lower QED scores.
    - **Introduce less drug-like functional groups**: For example, adding bulky or polar groups that reduce the drug-likeness.
    - **Modify aromatic systems**: Altering aromatic rings can significantly impact drug-likeness.
    - **Decrease polarity**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can lower QED.

4. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should retain core structural features of the root molecule, such as the aromatic systems and the sulfur atoms.

5. **Action Space**: Replace, add, or delete atoms or functional groups while ensuring the molecule remains synthetically feasible.

6. **Previous Experience**: Based on previous modifications, introducing bulky groups or altering the aromatic system has been effective in decreasing QED.

### Top Suggestion:
To decrease QED and maintain similarity, the best approach is to **replace the bromine atom with a bulkier, less polar functional group**, such as a tert-butyl group. This modification increases molecular weight and reduces polarity, which should lower the QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the bromine atom with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to carefully analyze the structure of the root molecule and identify modifications that will reduce its drug-likeness. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Analyze the Root Molecule**: The root molecule contains a benzene ring, an amide group, a ketone, and a cyclic ketone. These functional groups contribute to its drug-like properties, as they are common in pharmaceuticals.

2. **Identify Strategies to Decrease QED**:
   - **Introduce Bulky or Polar Groups**: Adding bulky or highly polar groups can decrease the QED by making the molecule less drug-like.
   - **Remove or Modify Functional Groups**: Removing or altering functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness (e.g., amides, ketones) can reduce the QED.
   - **Disrupt the Aromatic System**: Modifying the benzene ring can reduce aromaticity, which is often desirable in drug molecules.

3. **Consider Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the overall structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.

4. **Previous Experience**: Based on previous experience, modifying the amide or ketone groups has been effective in reducing QED while maintaining structural similarity.

**Final Suggestion**:
- Replace the amide group (O=C(N)) with a less drug-like group such as a sulfonamide group (O=S=O(N)).

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a sulfonamide group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while keeping the structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-like properties of the molecule. QED is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, hydrogen bonding, and polar surface area. To achieve the desired decrease, we can consider:

1. **Increasing Molecular Weight**: Adding larger functional groups can decrease QED.
2. **Increasing Lipophilicity**: Adding non-polar groups or reducing polar functional groups can reduce QED.
3. **Reducing Hydrogen Bonding**: Removing or modifying groups that participate in hydrogen bonding can decrease QED.
4. **Increasing Polar Surface Area**: Adding polar groups can also reduce QED.

Given the structure of the root molecule, one effective modification could be **adding a bulky, non-polar group** to the aromatic ring, which would increase lipophilicity and molecular weight, thus decreasing QED. Specifically, replacing a hydrogen atom on the aromatic ring with a tert-butyl group would achieve this.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule by at least 0.1, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To achieve the desired decrease in QED, we can consider the following modifications:

1. **Adding a bulky or non-polar group**: This can increase molecular weight and logP, making the molecule less drug-like.
2. **Removing a polar group**: This can reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, lowering the QED.
3. **Introducing a less common or less desirable functional group**: This can make the molecule less favorable from a drug-likeness perspective.
4. **Increasing the number of rotatable bonds**: This can decrease rigidity, making the molecule less drug-like.
5. **Modifying a ring structure**: Altering the ring size or introducing strain can reduce drug-likeness.

Given the structure of the root molecule, which contains a ketone, amide, and aromatic rings, a suitable modification would be to **replace the oxygen in the hydroxyl group with a sulfur atom**, forming a thiol group. This change introduces a less common functional group that is generally less desirable in drug molecules, thereby reducing the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule while maintaining structural similarity. Possible actions include:

1. **Adding bulky or polar groups**: Introducing bulky or polar groups can decrease the QED by reducing the molecule's drug-likeness. For example, adding a hydroxyl group or a sulfonate group can increase hydrophilicity and reduce QED.

2. **Replacing aromatic rings with non-aromatic rings**: Aromatic rings contribute to drug-likeness. Replacing one of the benzene rings with a cyclohexane ring can decrease QED.

3. **Introducing charged groups**: Adding a charged group like an amino group in a non-drug-like position can decrease QED.

4. **Increasing molecular weight**: Adding a large, non-drug-like substituent can decrease QED while maintaining some similarity.

5. **Disrupting hydrogen bonding**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED. For example, replacing an amide group with an ester group.

Given the previous information and the goal of reducing QED by at least 0.1, the top suggestion is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the benzene rings with a cyclohexane ring to decrease aromaticity and reduce QED."]
```

This modification maintains some structural similarity while significantly reducing the drug-likeness of the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **QED Reduction Strategy:** To decrease the QED by at least 0.1, we need to make the molecule less drug-like. This can be achieved by introducing structural changes that reduce molecular complexity, decrease hydrogen bonding potential, or increase hydrophobicity.

2. **Similarity Consideration:** The modified molecules should remain structurally similar to the root molecule. Therefore, the changes should be localized and not alter the core scaffold significantly.

3. **Functional Group Modification:** We will focus on modifying functional groups that contribute to drug-like properties, such as hydrogen bond donors/acceptors or polar groups.

4. **Action Space:** Based on the action space (add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group), we will consider modifications that reduce polarity or hydrogen bonding capacity.

5. **Previous Experience:** We will avoid repeating previous suggestions and focus on unique modifications that have not been tried before.

**Suggested Modification:**
Replace the amide group (-C(=O)N-) with a less polar and non-hydrogen bonding group, such as an ester (-C(=O)O-), to reduce hydrogen bonding potential and lower the QED.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group to reduce hydrogen bonding potential and decrease QED."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** Modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **Current QED:** 0.8187528065190176. The target QED should be less than 0.7187528065190176.

3. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we can introduce less drug-like features such as increasing molecular weight, adding bulky groups, or introducing polar groups that are less favorable in drug molecules.

4. **Structural Similarity:** The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. We should focus on peripheral changes.

5. **Action Space:** Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.

6. **Previous Experience:** Based on previous experiences, adding bulky or polar groups often decreases QED effectively while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. This means the modifications should be subtle yet impactful enough to reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule.

2. **Analyzing the Molecule**:
   - The root molecule contains several functional groups, including methoxy groups, a carbonyl group, and a heterocyclic ring system (pyrazole-like structure).
   - To decrease QED, we can consider adding or modifying functional groups that are less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as bulky groups, non-polar groups, or groups that disrupt the molecule's balance of properties.

3. **Possible Modifications**:
   - **Adding a Bulky Group**: Introducing a bulky substituent (e.g., a phenyl group) to reduce the molecule's drug-likeness.
   - **Replacing Polar Groups**: Replacing polar groups like methoxy groups with non-polar groups (e.g., methyl groups).
   - **Disrupting the Ring System**: Modifying the heterocyclic ring to make it less favorable for drug-likeness.

4. **Previous Experience**:
   - Adding bulky groups or reducing polarity has been effective in decreasing QED while maintaining structural similarity.

5. **Guidelines Adherence**:
   - The modification should be specific and consider similarity before and after the change.
   - The suggestion should not repeat previous modifications.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one methoxy group with a methyl group on the benzene ring to decrease polarity and disrupt drug-likeness."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **QED Reduction Goal**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.798, and we aim to reduce it by at least 0.1, targeting a QED below 0.698.

2. **Key Observations**: 
   - The molecule contains a nitrile group (C#N), an amino group (NH2), and a cyclic structure with an ammonium ion (NH+). These functional groups contribute to its drug-like properties.
   - To reduce QED, we should modify or remove groups that increase polarity, hydrogen bonding, or molecular complexity.

3. **Strategies**:
   - **Replace the nitrile group with a less polar group**: The nitrile group is highly polar and contributes to drug-likeness. Replacing it with a less polar group like an alkyl group could decrease the QED.
   - **Remove or modify the ammonium ion**: The charged ammonium ion increases polarity and hydrogen bonding, contributing to drug-likeness. Neutralizing or removing it could reduce QED.

4. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity to the original structure.

5. **Suggested Action**: Replace the nitrile group with a methyl group to reduce polarity and hydrogen bonding potential while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the given molecule (`CCc1cnc(CCNC(=O)C[C@H](C)C2CCCCC2)s1`) by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce drug-likeness. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, the presence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and polar surface area. To reduce QED, we can introduce or modify functional groups that decrease polarity, increase hydrophobicity, or reduce hydrogen bonding potential.

Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Reduce Polarity**: Introducing more hydrophobic groups or removing polar groups can decrease QED.
2. **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding bulky substituents can sometimes reduce QED.
3. **Remove Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Eliminating or replacing groups that participate in hydrogen bonding can decrease QED.
4. **Maintain Similarity**: Ensure the modified molecule retains the core structure of the input molecule.

Considering these factors, a suitable modification would be to **replace the amide group (C(=O)N) with a hydrophobic alkyl chain**, as this reduces polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** We need to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **QED Reduction Strategy:** QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polarity. To decrease QED, we can:
   - Increase molecular weight or logP.
   - Introduce more polar or bulky groups.
   - Reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

3. **Structural Similarity:** To maintain similarity, we should avoid drastic changes like removing or adding large rings or altering the core scaffold.

4. **Action Space:** Based on the available atoms and functional groups, we can:
   - Replace a methyl group with a bulkier or more polar group.
   - Add a polar group to increase molecular weight and polarity.
   - Replace the amide group with a less hydrogen-bonding group.

5. **Top Suggestion:** Replace the amide group (NC=O) with an ester group (COO), which reduces hydrogen-bonding capacity and increases polarity, thus lowering QED.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = [
    "Replace the amide group (NC=O) with an ester group (COO)."
]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The objective is to modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **Analysis of QED:** QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by various molecular properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we need to alter these properties in a way that makes the molecule less drug-like.

3. **Current Structure:** The root molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with an amine group, an amide group, and an ether linkage. These are common features in drug-like molecules.

4. **Strategies to Decrease QED:**
   - **Increase Molecular Weight:** Adding bulkier groups can decrease QED.
   - **Increase LogP:** Introducing hydrophobic groups can decrease QED.
   - **Increase Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors:** Adding more polar groups can decrease QED.
   - **Decrease Molecular Complexity:** Simplifying the structure by removing functional groups can decrease QED.

5. **Maintaining Similarity:** We should try to keep the core structure intact while modifying peripheral groups to ensure the molecule remains similar to the original.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC=O) with a hydrophobic alkyl group to increase the hydrophobicity and decrease the QED while maintaining the core structure."]

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task and reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Objective**: Modify the root molecule (CCCN1CC[NH+](C2CCC(C)(C)CC2)CC1) to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 (from 0.785 to below 0.685). The new molecules should remain structurally similar to the root molecule.

2. **Approach**:
   - To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as adding larger or more hydrophobic groups, introducing steric hindrance, or removing polar groups.
   - Since the molecule contains a quaternary ammonium group ([NH+]), modifications should focus on retaining some similarity while reducing drug-likeness.

3. **Proposed Modification**:
   - The molecule has a quaternary ammonium group, which is polar and positively charged, contributing to drug-likeness. To decrease QED, we can replace the positively charged nitrogen with a neutral, less polar group, such as a tertiary amine or a bulkier non-polar group.
   - Additionally, adding a large hydrophobic group can decrease QED by reducing solubility and increasing logP.

4. **Top Suggestion**:
   - Replace the positively charged nitrogen with a neutral tertiary amine and add a bulky hydrophobic group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) to reduce drug-likeness and decrease QED.

Here is the final suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the positively charged nitrogen with a neutral tertiary amine and add a tert-butyl group to decrease polarity and increase hydrophobicity."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original structure, we need to consider modifications that reduce drug-likeness. Drug-likeness is often associated with specific functional groups, molecular weight, and hydrogen bonding potential. Decreasing QED can be achieved by introducing less favorable features for drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular complexity, adding bulky or polar groups, or reducing hydrogen bonding capacity.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Increase Molecular Complexity**: Adding larger or more complex groups can reduce drug-likeness.
2. **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Bulky groups can decrease QED by making the molecule less compact and less likely to bind to biological targets.
3. **Reduce Hydrogen Bonding**: Removing or replacing groups that participate in hydrogen bonding can decrease QED.
4. **Add Polar Groups**: Introducing polar groups that are not typically found in drugs can reduce drug-likeness.

### Suggested Modification:
Based on the guidelines and the reasoning, I suggest replacing the **sulfonyl group** (S(=O)(=O)) with a **phosphonyl group** (P(=O)(=O)). This increases the molecular weight and introduces a more complex and less common functional group, which is likely to decrease QED and reduce drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonyl group with a phosphonyl group in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that reduce drug-likeness while maintaining molecular similarity. Here’s how I would approach this:

1. **Identify key functional groups**: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (`S(=O)(=O)N`), a fluorine atom, a triazole ring, and a benzene ring. These groups contribute to the drug-likeness of the molecule.
2. **Modify functional groups**: To reduce QED, we can modify or replace these groups with less drug-like groups or introduce steric hindrance.
3. **Maintain similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.

Given these considerations, here’s a suggestion for modification:

- **Replace the fluorine atom on the benzene ring with a bulky alkyl group**: This will decrease the drug-likeness by introducing a more hydrophobic and less polar group, which can reduce QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluorine atom on the benzene ring with a bulky alkyl group"]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To address the task, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Goal**: Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Constraints**: The modifications should involve adding, deleting, or replacing atoms or functional groups, and the output should be a sentence of modification instruction.
3. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, adding hydrophobic groups, or introducing steric hindrance. However, we need to ensure the molecule remains similar to the original.

**Reasoning Process**:
- The root molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings, fluorine, chlorine, and nitrogen-containing groups.
- To decrease QED, we can modify the molecule by adding bulky groups or introducing less favorable features like large hydrophobic groups or polar groups that disrupt drug-likeness.
- We should focus on modifying parts of the molecule that are less critical to its core structure to maintain similarity.

**Final Suggestion**:
Based on the above reasoning, the top suggestion is to add a bulky hydrophobic group to the molecule, which will decrease its drug-likeness and QED.

final_suggestion = ["Add a tert-butyl group to the nitrogen atom in the pyrrole ring."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

The goal is to modify the molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule. Given the QED of the root molecule is 0.9029, the target QED after modification should be ≤0.8029.

To achieve this, we need to introduce changes that reduce drug-likeness, such as adding or modifying functional groups that are less favorable in drug-like molecules. Here are some considerations:

1. **Introducing Larger or Bulky Groups**: Adding larger or more complex groups can decrease QED by increasing molecular weight or reducing solubility.
2. **Removing Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors can decrease QED, as these are important for drug-likeness.
3. **Adding Hydrophobic Groups**: Adding hydrophobic groups like aliphatic chains can reduce QED by decreasing solubility.

Given the structural complexity of the root molecule, we should focus on modifications that do not drastically alter the core structure but introduce changes that reduce drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amino group with a tert-butyl group"]
```

This suggestion introduces a bulky, hydrophobic group, which is likely to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal**: Modify the given molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The current QED of the root molecule is 0.803, so the target QED should be ≤ 0.703.
2. **Strategy**:
   - To decrease QED, we need to make the molecule less drug-like. This can be achieved by adding bulky or polar groups, introducing unfavorable steric interactions, or reducing solubility.
   - The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (`S(=O)(=O)N`), an aromatic ring (`c1ccccc1`), and an ester group (`C(=O)OC`). Modifying these groups can significantly impact QED.
   - To maintain similarity, we should avoid drastic changes and focus on subtle modifications.

3. **Action Plan**:
   - Replace the ester group (`C(=O)OC`) with a less drug-like functional group, such as a carboxylic acid (`C(=O)OH`), which is more polar and less favorable in drug-like molecules.
   - This modification reduces QED by increasing hydrophilicity and decreasing lipophilicity.

4. **Previous Experience**:
   - Past modifications have shown that replacing functional groups with polar or bulky alternatives effectively reduces QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ester group with a carboxylic acid group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining its similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-like properties. This can be achieved by introducing or modifying functional groups that are less favorable in drug design. Here are some possible actions:

1. **Add a bulky group**: Introducing a bulky group can reduce the QED by making the molecule less drug-like. For example, adding a tert-butyl group to the aromatic ring.
2. **Replace a hydrogen with a halogen**: Replacing a hydrogen atom with a halogen (e.g., chlorine or bromine) can decrease the QED, as halogens are often less desirable in drug molecules.
3. **Replace the ether oxygen with a sulfur atom**: Sulfur atoms are generally less favorable in drug molecules compared to oxygen atoms.
4. **Introduce a nitro group**: Nitro groups are often avoided in drug design due to their potential for toxicity and metabolic instability.
5. **Add a polar group in an unfavorable position**: Introducing a polar group (e.g., a carboxyl group) in a position that disrupts the molecule’s overall polarity can decrease the QED.

After considering these options, the most promising action to achieve the desired decrease in QED while maintaining similarity is to **replace the ether oxygen with a sulfur atom**. This modification is likely to significantly impact the QED while keeping the overall structure of the molecule intact.

final_suggestion = ["Replace the ether oxygen with a sulfur atom."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that disrupt drug-like properties without drastically altering the core structure. From the guidelines and previous experience, we know that adding bulky or non-drug-like groups, removing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, or introducing less polar groups can effectively decrease QED.

Here’s the reasoning process:
1. **Bulky Group Addition**: Adding a bulky group (e.g., a tert-butyl group) can decrease QED by making the molecule less drug-like and more hydrophobic.
2. **Hydrogen Bond Donor/Acceptor Removal**: Removing or replacing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors (e.g., the amide group) can reduce QED significantly.
3. **Non-Polar Group Introduction**: Introducing non-polar groups (e.g., a methyl group) can decrease polarity and QED.
4. **Substitution with Sterically Hindered Groups**: Replacing smaller groups with sterically hindered groups can disrupt drug-like properties.

Based on this, the top-1 suggestion is:
- **Replace the amide group with a non-polar methyl group**.

This modification directly removes a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a non-polar methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal Interpretation:** The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should still be structurally similar to the root molecule.

2. **QED Analysis:** The QED of the root molecule is 0.7205760171324056. To decrease it by at least 0.1, the new QED should be ≤ 0.6205760171324056.

3. **Structural Considerations:** The root molecule features a complex structure with multiple rings (benzene and heterocycles), a methoxy group, a fluorine atom, and a morpholine-like ring. To decrease QED, modifications that reduce drug-likeness could include:
   - Introducing bulky groups that disrupt favorable interactions.
   - Removing or replacing polar functional groups that contribute to good solubility or binding affinity.
   - Adding groups that increase hydrophobicity or decrease solubility.

4. **Suggestions Based on Previous Experience:**
   - **Replace the fluorine atom with a more hydrophobic group** (e.g., a chlorine or methyl group). Fluorine is often favorable in drug design due to its polarity and ability to form hydrogen bonds.
   - **Replace the methoxy group with a larger, less polar group** (e.g., an ethoxy or isopropoxy group). This would decrease polarity and likely reduce QED.
   - **Add a hydrophobic group to the morpholine-like ring** (e.g., a methyl substitution on the nitrogen or carbon atoms of the ring). This could disrupt favorable interactions.

5. **Final Decision:** The most effective modification is likely to be **replacing the methoxy group with a larger, less polar group**, as this will significantly decrease the polarity and likely reduce the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group attached to the benzene ring with an ethoxy group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we can consider the following reasoning:

1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we should alter the molecule in a way that reduces drug-like properties, such as increasing hydrophobicity, reducing hydrogen bonding potential, or increasing molecular weight.

2. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should be minimal and focused on specific functional groups or atoms to ensure the new molecules remain structurally similar to the original.

3. **Suggested Modifications**:
   - **Replace the hydroxyl group with a less polar group**: The hydroxyl group contributes to hydrogen bonding and polarity, which enhances drug-likeness. Replacing it with a less polar group, such as a methyl group, would decrease QED.
   - **Introduce a bulky group**: Adding a bulky group like a tert-butyl group could increase molecular weight and hydrophobicity, reducing QED.
   - **Remove a hydrogen bond acceptor**: The nitrogen in the pyrrole ring (part of the `ncccn1` structure) can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor. Replacing it with a carbon would reduce hydrogen bonding potential.
   - **Introduce a halogen**: Adding a halogen (e.g., chlorine or fluorine) can increase hydrophobicity and reduce drug-likeness.
   - **Increase steric hindrance**: Modifying the structure to introduce steric hindrance can reduce drug-likeness.

Given the above reasoning, the top suggestion to achieve the goal is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group with a methyl group to decrease polarity and hydrogen bonding potential."]

To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as adding bulky groups, increasing hydrophobicity, or introducing less favorable functional groups.

Given the structure of the root molecule `C[C@H](CNC(=O)c1ccnc(OC2CCC2)c1)C[C@@H](C)O`, here are some possible modifications that could achieve the goal:

1. **Replace the hydroxyl group with a larger, less polar group**: This would increase hydrophobicity and reduce drug-likeness.
2. **Add a bulky group to the aromatic ring**: This would increase molecular weight and steric hindrance, reducing drug-likeness.
3. **Replace the amide group with a less polar functional group**: This would decrease polarity and reduce drug-likeness.
4. **Introduce a halogen atom to the aromatic ring**: This would increase hydrophobicity and reduce drug-likeness.
5. **Replace the cyclic ether (OC2CCC2) with a less polar cyclic group**: This would decrease polarity and reduce drug-likeness.

Considering the guidelines and the need for similarity, the most effective modification likely involves altering a functional group that significantly impacts QED while maintaining structural similarity. Therefore, the top suggestion is to **replace the hydroxyl group with a larger, less polar group**.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group with a larger, less polar group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To address the task, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **QED Analysis**: The current QED of the root molecule is 0.7919. We need to lower this value to below 0.6919.

3. **Strategies to Decrease QED**:
   - **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding bulky groups can decrease QED.
   - **Introduce Less Drug-like Features**: Adding polar or charged groups can reduce drug-likeness.
   - **Decrease Solubility**: Adding hydrophobic groups can decrease QED.
   - **Increase Complexity**: Adding rings or branching can reduce QED.

4. **Considerations**:
   - The modification should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.
   - The changes should be specific and not repetitive of previous suggestions.

5. **Proposed Action**:
   - **Add a Hydrophobic Group**: Introducing a hydrophobic group like a phenyl ring can decrease QED by increasing molecular weight and hydrophobicity, which are factors that lower QED.

**Reasoning**:
Adding a phenyl group to the molecule will increase its molecular weight and hydrophobicity, both of which contribute to a lower QED. This modification is likely to meet the threshold of decreasing QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a phenyl group to the nitrogen atom in the amide group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the root molecule, we need to make modifications that reduce drug-likeness. This can be achieved by introducing less favorable features in drug design, such as increasing molecular weight, introducing less polar or more hydrophobic groups, or adding steric hindrance. 

The root molecule contains multiple hydroxyl groups and a glycosidic bond, which are polar and contribute to its drug-like properties. To decrease QED, we can modify or replace one or more of these hydroxyl groups with less polar or bulkier functional groups. 

Based on this rationale, the top suggestion would be to **replace one of the hydroxyl groups with a tert-butyl group**, which is bulkier and less polar, thereby reducing the drug-likeness of the molecule.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace one of the hydroxyl groups with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to modify the molecule in a way that disrupts drug-like properties. Here is the reasoning process:

1. **Drug-like properties**: Molecules with high QED typically have balanced hydrophobicity, molecular weight, hydrogen bonding, and flexibility. To decrease QED, we should introduce features that disrupt these properties, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or introducing steric hindrance.

2. **Structural similarity**: To maintain similarity, the modifications should target specific functional groups or atoms without drastically changing the core structure.

3. **Previous experience**: Based on chemical knowledge, adding bulky or polar groups often decreases QED significantly.

Considering these points, the top suggestion is:

**"Replace the trifluoromethyl group with a hydroxyl group and a nitro group attached to the same carbon."**

This modification introduces polar and bulky groups, which should decrease QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

Here is the `final_suggestion` list:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the trifluoromethyl group with a hydroxyl group and a nitro group attached to the same carbon."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule by at least 0.1, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-likeness. The QED score is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, logP, and polar surface area. To achieve this, we can:

1. **Increase Molecular Weight:** Adding larger functional groups or atoms can increase the molecular weight, which may reduce drug-likeness.
2. **Decrease Polarity:** Introducing non-polar or hydrophobic groups can decrease the molecule's polarity, which often reduces QED.
3. **Increase Complexity:** Adding complex or bulky substituents can reduce drug-likeness by making the molecule less suitable for drug-like properties.

Given the structure of the root molecule, we can focus on modifying the side chain or the aromatic ring to introduce less drug-like features.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Replace the chloride atom on the aromatic ring with a more complex and less polar group, such as a tertiary butyl group.** This modification will increase the molecular weight and hydrophobicity, thereby reducing the QED score.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the chloride atom on the aromatic ring with a tertiary butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: The task is to modify the given molecule (`CCc1ccc(CNC(=O)c2cc(-c3ccncc3)cn2C)cc1`) to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should be similar to the original molecule.

2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the original molecule is 0.781. To decrease it by at least 0.1, the new QED should be below 0.681.

3. **Strategies to Decrease QED**:
   - **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding bulky groups can decrease QED.
   - **Introduce Non-drug-like Features**: Adding groups like long alkyl chains, or groups that disrupt aromaticity can make the molecule less drug-like.
   - **Reduce Hydrogen Bonding**: Removing or altering hydrogen bond donors/acceptors can reduce QED.
   - **Increase LogP**: Adding hydrophobic groups can decrease QED.

4. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should be minimal to keep the new molecules similar to the original.

5. **Action Space**: We can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups, but the modification should not repeat previous suggestions.

6. **Top-1 Suggestion**: Based on the above reasoning, I suggest replacing the amide group (`C(=O)`) with a more hydrophobic and less drug-like ester group (`COO`), which is likely to decrease QED by making the molecule more hydrophobic and less favorable for drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:

The Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and polarity. Lowering the QED can be achieved by introducing less favorable drug-like features, such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding bulky groups, or introducing charged species.

Since we need to maintain structural similarity, we should focus on modifying functional groups or atoms that do not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. For example, we can replace polar or small groups with larger, non-polar groups or introduce steric hindrance.

### Reasoning Steps:
1. **Identify Key Functional Groups**: The molecule contains a sulfonamide group, a nitro group, a ketone, and two chlorine atoms. These are all polar or electronegative groups that contribute to the molecule's drug-likeness.
2. **Target Modifications**: Replace or modify these groups to reduce polarity or increase steric hindrance.
3. **Maintain Similarity**: Ensure that the modifications do not drastically change the core scaffold of the molecule.

### Suggestion:
Replace the sulfonamide group with a more hydrophobic and bulky group, such as a tert-butyl group. This will decrease polarity and increase steric hindrance, thereby reducing the QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonamide group with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce changes that make the molecule less drug-like. QED is influenced by various molecular properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To reduce QED, we can:

1. **Increase molecular weight** by adding large, non-drug-like groups.
2. **Increase hydrophobicity** (logP) by adding non-polar groups.
3. **Introduce steric hindrance** by adding bulky groups.
4. **Reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors** by modifying or removing polar groups.

Given the structure of the root molecule (`COc1cc(CNc2ccc(F)c(C)c2)cc([N+](=O)[O-])c1O`), we can target the hydroxyl group, nitro group, or methoxy group for modification. These groups are polar and contribute to QED. By replacing them with less polar or bulkier groups, we can reduce QED.

### Final Suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitro group with a tert-butyl group."]
```

This modification increases the molecular weight and introduces a bulky, non-polar group, which is likely to decrease QED significantly. The tert-butyl group is also less drug-like, aligning with the goal of making the molecule less like a drug.

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the problem and think through the solution step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the given molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease the QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The QED of the original molecule is 0.805, so the new QED should be ≤ 0.705.
   - The new molecules should be similar in structure to the original molecule.
   - The modifications should not repeat previous suggestions.
   - The modification should be a specific instruction, not a SMILES string.
3. **Approach**:
   - To decrease QED, we should introduce features that are less drug-like, such as:
     - Adding bulky or polar groups.
     - Reducing aromaticity.
     - Introducing or increasing hydrophobic regions.
   - To maintain similarity, the modifications should be minimal and focused on key functional groups.

4. **Potential Modifications**:
   - Replace the carbonyl group in the ester linkage with a less polar functional group.
   - Introduce a large, bulky substituent to disrupt the molecular planarity.
   - Replace the aromatic ring with a less aromatic or non-aromatic ring system.
   - Add a polar or charged group to disrupt the lipophilic balance.

5. **Final Suggestion**:
   - To significantly decrease QED while maintaining similarity, I suggest replacing the ester carbonyl group with a less polar and bulkier functional group, such as an ether linkage. This will disrupt the planar structure and decrease the drug-likeness of the molecule.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ester carbonyl group with an ether linkage."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the problem step-by-step to achieve the goal:

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Current QED**: 0.8489. The target QED should be ≤ 0.7489.
3. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we can make the molecule less soluble, bulky, or reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors. However, we need to maintain structural similarity.
4. **Target Substructure**: The molecule contains a benzyl group (`CCc3ccccc3`), a morpholine-like ring (`C[C@H]1CN...CO1`), and a nitroso group (`no2`). These are potential areas for modification.
5. **Modification Options**:
   - Replace the benzyl group with a larger, less soluble group.
   - Modify the nitroso group to reduce hydrogen bond acceptor potential.
   - Add bulky substituents to decrease solubility and QED.
   - Replace or add hydrophobic groups.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the reasoning, the best action is to replace the benzyl group (`CCc3ccccc3`) with a bulkier, less soluble group like a biphenyl group. This modification will decrease QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the benzyl group with a biphenyl group to increase bulkiness and reduce solubility."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the root molecule, we need to consider modifications that are known to negatively impact drug-likeness. These could include adding or removing polar functional groups, introducing steric hindrance, or reducing hydrophobicity. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Polarity Increase**: Adding polar functional groups can decrease QED because it reduces the balance between hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity.
2. **Steric Hindrance**: Introducing bulky groups can reduce drug-likeness by increasing molecular weight and complexity.
3. **Hydrophobicity Reduction**: Reducing hydrophobic character can lower QED by making the molecule less balanced in terms of lipophilicity.

Given the structure of the root molecule, a good strategy would be to introduce a polar group or a bulky substituent that does not drastically alter the core structure but significantly impacts the QED. 

#### Top-1 Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methyl group attached to the thiophene ring with a hydroxyl group."]
```

This modification increases polarity, which is likely to decrease the QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce the molecule's drug-like properties. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify Functional Groups**: The root molecule contains ester, amide, and ether functional groups, which are common in drug-like molecules. 
2. **Modify Functional Groups**: To decrease QED, we can modify these functional groups into less drug-like ones. For example, replacing an ester group with a less polar or more complex structure can reduce QED.
3. **Introduce Bulky Groups**: Adding bulky or non-polar groups can decrease QED by reducing solubility or increasing steric hindrance.
4. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should be relatively minor to maintain structural similarity to the root molecule.

Based on this reasoning, the suggestion is to **replace one of the amide groups with a less polar and bulkier functional group, such as a thioester group**. This change will reduce the molecule's drug-likeness while keeping the overall structure similar.

final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (C(=O)N) connected to the piperidine ring with a thioester group (C(=O)S) to decrease QED."]

1. **Goal:** The task is to modify the `root_molecule` (CSc1ccccc1[C@@H]([NH3+])c1ccc(C)o1) to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while keeping the modified molecules similar to the original.

2. **QED Reduction Strategy:** To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are less desirable in drug-like molecules. This can be achieved by:
   - Adding bulky or non-polar groups.
   - Introducing functional groups that are less common in drugs.
   - Increasing molecular weight or lipophilicity.

3. **Maintaining Similarity:** The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. We should focus on peripheral changes to the aromatic rings or the side chains.

4. **Avoiding Repetition:** Ensure that the modifications are unique and not repeated from previous suggestions.

5. **Modification Examples:** Based on the above reasoning, here are potential modifications:
   - Adding a chlorine atom to the aromatic ring.
   - Replacing the hydroxyl group with a nitro group.
   - Adding a phenyl group to the aromatic ring.
   - Replacing the methyl group with a tert-butyl group.
   - Adding a sulfonyl group to the aromatic ring.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a chlorine atom to the aromatic ring."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the intent of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Goal**: Decrease QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.
2. **Strategy**: Modify functional groups or atoms that contribute to drug-likeness, such as polar groups, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, or aromatic systems.
3. **Considerations**:
   - The molecule contains a complex structure with multiple aromatic rings, an amide group, and a nitrile group. Modifying these could impact drug-likeness.
   - To maintain similarity, changes should be localized and not drastically alter the core structure.
   - The modification should reduce the QED significantly.

**Potential Modifications**:
- **Replace the nitrile group with a less polar group**: Nitrile groups are often associated with drug-likeness due to their polarity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. Replacing it with a less polar group like a methyl group could decrease QED.
- **Remove the amide group**: Amides are also highly polar and contribute to drug-likeness. Removing or replacing the amide group could reduce QED.
- **Introduce steric bulk**: Adding a bulky substituent could decrease the molecule’s ability to interact with biological targets, reducing drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion**:
Based on the above reasoning, the most effective modification would be to replace the nitrile group with a less polar group, such as a methyl group, to reduce QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitrile group with a methyl group in the molecule."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

1. **Goal**: Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Approach**: Identify functional groups or atoms in the molecule that significantly contribute to its drug-like properties, such as the amide bond, the tertiary amine, or the cyclopentane ring. Modify these groups to reduce their contribution to the QED.
3. **Considerations**:
   - The amide bond is a key feature that contributes to the drug-likeness of the molecule. Replacing it with a less polar or less biologically relevant group could decrease the QED.
   - The tertiary amine (especially in the cyclopentane ring) could be modified to a less basic group, reducing its contribution to the QED.
   - The cyclopentane ring could be opened or modified to a less rigid structure, reducing its drug-like nature.

4. **Suggested Modification**: Replace the amide bond (C(=O)N) with an ester bond (C(=O)O). This modification introduces a less polar and less biologically relevant group, which should decrease the QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide bond (C=O) adjacent to the cyclopentane ring with an ester bond (C=O)."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-likeness. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by various factors such as molecular weight, polarity, hydrogen bonding, and lipophilicity. To decrease QED, we can:

1. **Increase molecular weight**: Adding larger functional groups can decrease QED.
2. **Increase polarity**: Introducing polar groups can decrease QED.
3. **Disrupt hydrogen bonding**: Removing or modifying groups involved in hydrogen bonding can decrease QED.
4. **Increase lipophilicity**: Adding hydrophobic groups can decrease QED.

Given the structure of the root molecule, we can consider modifying the aromatic ring or the functional groups attached to it. The presence of the trifluoromethoxy group (OC(F)(F)F) is already quite polar and could be a good target for modification.

**Reasoning Process**:
- The trifluoromethoxy group is highly polar and contributes to the drug-likeness of the molecule. Replacing it with a less polar or larger group could decrease QED significantly.
- The aromatic ring could also be modified by adding bulkier substituents to increase molecular weight and disrupt the overall drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the trifluoromethoxy group with a tert-butyl group to increase molecular weight and decrease polarity."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Goal Understanding**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1. The modified molecules should remain similar to the root molecule.

2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.821971178635812. To decrease QED by at least 0.1, the new QED should be below 0.721971178635812.

3. **Modification Strategy**: 
   - **Add or Replace Functional Groups**: Adding or replacing functional groups with less drug-like properties can decrease QED.
   - **Delete Functional Groups**: Removing functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness can also decrease QED.
   - **Steric Hindrance**: Introducing bulky groups or increasing steric hindrance can reduce QED.

4. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should maintain similarity to the root molecule, so changes should be limited to specific functional groups or atoms.

5. **Previous Experience**: Based on previous experiences, replacing or deleting oxygen-containing groups (like hydroxyl) or adding sterically bulky groups (like phenyl) can effectively decrease QED while maintaining similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
- **Replace the hydroxyl group with a hydrogen atom**: This modification removes a polar, drug-like functional group, decreasing QED while maintaining structural similarity.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-like properties. This can be achieved by introducing changes that decrease molecular complexity, increase hydrophobicity, or disrupt favorable drug-like features such as hydrogen bonding or polarity.

Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify key drug-like features**:
   - The molecule contains an amide group (C(=O)N), a cyclic ether (CCOC), and an aromatic ring (c1ccccc1). These are common features in drug-like molecules.
   - The QED is high (0.932), suggesting that the molecule has multiple favorable drug-like properties.

2. **Strategies to reduce QED**:
   - **Increase hydrophobicity**: Replace polar groups (e.g., amide or ether) with non-polar groups (e.g., alkyl chains or aromatic rings).
   - **Disrupt hydrogen bonding**: Remove or replace hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.
   - **Increase molecular weight or complexity**: Add bulky groups or rings that are less drug-like.

3. **Suggested modifications**:
   - Replace the amide group (C(=O)N) with a non-polar group like an alkyl chain.
   - Replace the cyclic ether (CCOC) with a non-polar ring or alkyl group.
   - Remove or replace the aromatic ring with a less polar structure.

2. **Strategy**: Modify functional groups or atoms that decrease drug-like properties, such as increasing hydrophobicity, reducing hydrogen bonding capacity, or introducing steric hindrance.
3. **Considerations**: Ensure the modifications are not extreme to maintain similarity to the root molecule. Avoid changes that might drastically alter the core structure.

### Analysis of Root Molecule:
- The root molecule contains a benzimidazole core, a carbonyl group, and an amide linkage.
- To decrease QED, one could modify the amide group, which contributes to hydrogen bonding, or introduce bulkier groups to reduce solubility.

### Suggestion:
- Replace the carbonyl group in the amide linkage with a less polar functional group (e.g., a methylene group), which would reduce hydrogen bonding capacity and decrease QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide linkage with a methylene group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while ensuring the modified molecules remain similar to the original structure.

2. **QED Reduction Strategy:** To reduce QED, we need to make the molecule less drug-like by introducing changes that typically decrease QED, such as increasing molecular weight, introducing bulky groups, or reducing solubility.

3. **Maintaining Similarity:** To maintain similarity, we should focus on modifying functional groups or atoms that do not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule.

4. **Action Space:** Based on the action space, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. Given the need to reduce QED, introducing bulkier or less polar groups would be effective.

5. **Learning from Previous Experience:** We avoid repeating previous suggestions and focus on introducing new modifications that have not been tried before.

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group in the molecule with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To address the goal of modifying the molecule `COCCNC(=O)c1csc(COc2ccccc2Cl)n1` to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity, we need to consider the following:

1. **QED Reduction**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.7947. To reduce it by at least 0.1, the new QED should be below 0.6947.
2. **Structural Similarity**: The modified molecules should remain structurally similar to the root molecule, meaning changes should be minimal and focused on specific functional groups or atoms.
3. **Drug-Likeness Reduction**: To make the molecule "less like a drug," we can introduce modifications that decrease its drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular weight or adding less common functional groups.

### Reasoning Process:
- **Functional Group Replacement**: Replacing a drug-like functional group (e.g., amide, ether) with a less common or less drug-like group can reduce QED.
- **Adding Bulkier Groups**: Introducing larger or less polar groups can decrease QED by increasing molecular weight or reducing solubility.
- **Removing Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors**: Reducing hydrogen bonding potential can decrease drug-likeness and QED.

### Suggested Action:
Replace the ether group (`COc2ccccc2Cl`) with a bulkier and less polar alkyl group, such as a propyl group. This modification will reduce QED by increasing hydrophobicity and molecular weight.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ether group (COc2ccccc2Cl) with a propyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we can consider the following reasoning:

1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, hydrogen bonding, and polarity. To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that increase molecular weight, reduce lipophilicity, or disrupt hydrogen bonding.

2. **Similarity Maintenance**: To ensure the modified molecules remain similar to the original, we should focus on small, localized changes rather than large structural modifications.

3. **Functional Group Modifications**: By adding or replacing functional groups with less drug-like properties, we can effectively reduce QED. For example, adding bulky or polar groups can decrease lipophilicity and disrupt hydrogen bonding.

4. **Examples of Effective Modifications**:
   - Adding a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring to increase polarity.
   - Replacing the sulfonyl group with a less polar functional group.
   - Adding a bulky functional group to the nitrogen atom to disrupt hydrogen bonding.

Based on this reasoning, here is the top-1 suggestion:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonyl group with a carboxyl group to decrease lipophilicity and disrupt hydrogen bonding."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule. Here are some possible actions based on the guidelines:

1. **Reasoning Process**:
   - **QED Reduction**: To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as larger, more hydrophobic groups or modifications that reduce the balance of properties like molecular weight, polarity, and hydrogen bonding.
   - **Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.
   - **Previous Experience**: Based on previous experience, replacing polar or hydrogen-bonding groups with non-polar or larger groups often decreases QED.

2. **Possible Modifications**:
   - Replace the carbonyl group with a non-polar carbon-carbon double bond.
   - Replace the hydroxyl group with a larger hydrophobic group such as a phenyl group.
   - Replace the amide group with a less polar group like a thioamide.
   - Add a bulky alkyl group to the aromatic ring to increase hydrophobicity.
   - Replace the chlorine atom with a larger halogen like bromine or iodine.

3. **Final Suggestion**:
   Based on the above reasoning, the most effective modification to decrease QED while maintaining similarity is to replace the hydroxyl group with a larger hydrophobic group such as a phenyl group. This modification will increase the hydrophobicity and bulkiness of the molecule, reducing its drug-likeness.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group with a phenyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule `Cc1ccoc1C(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1Br` to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **Current QED**: 0.9173180809716711. The target QED after modification should be ≤ 0.8173180809716711.

3. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The modified molecule should remain similar to the original.
   - The suggestion should not repeat previous modifications.
   - Avoid abbreviations (e.g., use "hydroxyl group" instead of "OH").

### Reasoning Process:
To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that make the molecule less drug-like. Common strategies include:
- Increasing molecular weight or introducing bulky groups.
- Adding polar or charged groups that disrupt drug-like properties.
- Introducing groups that decrease solubility or increase hydrophobicity.

Given the structure of the molecule, we can target specific regions for modification, such as the aromatic ring, the amide bond, or the halogens.

### Suggestion:
Replace the fluorine atom with a nitro group. The nitro group is more polar and bulky, which can significantly decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluorine atom with a nitro group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. Based on the guidelines, here’s the reasoning process:

1. **QED Considerations**: The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. Decreasing QED can be achieved by:
   - Increasing molecular weight.
   - Introducing bulky or less polar groups.
   - Reducing hydrogen bond acceptors or donors.
   - Introducing steric hindrance.

2. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should be minimal to retain the structural similarity to the root molecule. This can be achieved by:
   - Replacing small functional groups with larger or less polar ones.
   - Adding small groups that disrupt drug-like properties without drastically altering the core structure.

3. **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure the suggestion does not repeat previous modifications.

4. **Modification Strategy**:
   - **Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) with a less polar group** like a thioether group (C-S-C), which would reduce polarity and disrupt hydrogen bonding.
   - **Add a bulky group** like a tert-butyl group to increase steric hindrance and reduce drug-likeness.
   - **Replace the sulfonyl group (SO2) with a larger, less polar group** like a phosphonate group (PO3).
   - **Introduce a non-polar aromatic ring** to increase hydrophobicity.
   - **Replace the amide group (CONH) with a less polar group** like an ester (COO).

**Top Suggestion**: Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) in the amide linkage with a thioether group (C-S-C), which reduces polarity and disrupts hydrogen bonding, thereby decreasing QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide linkage with a thioether group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to make strategic modifications that reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Understanding QED**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, solubility, and presence of functional groups that are typically found in drugs. To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are less common in drug-like molecules or disrupt existing drug-like features.

2. **Targeting Substructure**: The root molecule contains a bromo-substituted phenyl ring, a fluorine atom, and a carbonyl group, which are common in drug molecules. Modifying these regions could reduce QED.

3. **Modification Strategy**:
   - **Add Bulky Groups**: Adding large, non-polar groups can decrease solubility and disrupt drug-likeness.
   - **Remove Polar Groups**: Removing polar groups like the carbonyl group can reduce drug-likeness.
   - **Introduce Non-Drug-Like Features**: Adding groups like nitro or sulfonates, which are less common in drugs, can decrease QED.

4. **Similarity Consideration**: The modifications should be minimal to maintain structural similarity to the root molecule.

Based on this reasoning, the top suggestion is:

```python
# Replace the carbonyl group with a nitro group to decrease drug-likeness while maintaining structural similarity.
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group with a nitro group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties of the molecule. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and polar surface area. 

Here are some possible modifications that could decrease QED:

1. **Replace the fluorine atom with a larger halogen** such as chlorine or bromine. This increases molecular weight and logP, which could decrease QED.
2. **Replace the amide group with a less polar functional group** such as an ether or ester. This reduces hydrogen bonding potential and polar surface area.
3. **Introduce a bulky substituent** on the aromatic ring. This increases molecular weight and decreases QED.
4. **Replace the aromatic nitrogen in the triazole ring with a sulfur atom** to form a thiazole ring. This changes the electronic properties and reduces drug-likeness.
5. **Replace the methyl group with a larger alkyl group** such as an ethyl or propyl group. This increases molecular weight and logP.

Based on previous experience and the goal of maintaining similarity while decreasing QED, the most promising modification is replacing the amide group with a less polar functional group, as it directly reduces hydrogen bonding potential and polar surface area, which are key contributors to QED.

Here is the final suggestion in Python list format:

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the root molecule, we need to consider the following:

1. **QED Reduction**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can increase molecular weight, increase logP, or reduce the number of hydrogen bond acceptors/donors.

2. **Similarity**: The modified molecules should retain the core structure of the root molecule to ensure similarity. This means we should avoid altering the central scaffold or key functional groups significantly.

3. **Actions**: Based on the action space, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. To decrease QED, we can:
   - Add a hydrophobic group (increase logP).
   - Replace a polar group with a non-polar group (reduce hydrogen bonding).
   - Introduce a bulky group (increase molecular weight).

**Reasoning Process**:
- The root molecule contains a sulfonamide group (polar) and an amide group (polar). Replacing one of these polar groups with a non-polar group will reduce hydrogen bonding and decrease QED.
- Adding a hydrophobic group (e.g., a phenyl ring) to the molecule will increase logP and molecular weight, further reducing QED.
- Replacing a hydrogen bond acceptor (e.g., the carbonyl oxygen) with a non-polar group (e.g., a methylene group) will also decrease QED.

**Final Suggestion**:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonamide group with a methylene group to reduce hydrogen bonding and decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we can consider making modifications that reduce the drug-like properties. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify drug-like features**: The molecule contains several features typical of drugs, such as a piperidine ring, a pyrazole ring, and a tertiary amine. Modifying these features can reduce drug-likeness.
2. **Reduce hydrogen bond donors/acceptors**: The molecule has multiple hydrogen bond donors (e.g., NH groups) and acceptors (e.g., N atoms in the rings). Reducing these can lower QED.
3. **Increase molecular weight or hydrophobicity**: Adding bulkier or more hydrophobic groups can decrease QED.
4. **Maintain similarity**: The modifications should not drastically change the overall structure to maintain similarity to the original molecule.

Based on this reasoning, the top-1 suggestion is to replace the piperidine ring with a more bulky and less polar structure, such as a cyclohexane ring, which will reduce the hydrogen bond donor count and increase hydrophobicity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the piperidine ring with a cyclohexane ring to reduce hydrogen bond donors and increase hydrophobicity."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule `C=CCNS(=O)(=O)c1cccnc1Cl` by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to make modifications that reduce its drug-like properties. This can be achieved by introducing changes that decrease solubility, increase molecular weight, or introduce steric hindrance. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Decrease Solubility**: Introducing hydrophobic groups or removing polar groups can decrease solubility, which reduces QED.
2. **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding larger substituents can increase molecular weight, which tends to decrease QED.
3. **Introduce Steric Hindrance**: Adding bulky groups can reduce drug-likeness by making the molecule less likely to bind to biological targets.

### Modification Suggestions:
- **Add a hydrophobic group**: Adding a hydrophobic group like a phenyl ring can decrease solubility and increase molecular weight.
- **Replace the sulfonamide group**: The sulfonamide group is polar and contributes to drug-likeness. Replacing it with a less polar group can decrease QED.
- **Add a bulky substituent**: Adding a bulky group like a tert-butyl group can introduce steric hindrance and reduce drug-likeness.
- **Replace the chlorine atom**: The chlorine atom is a halogen that can contribute to drug-likeness. Replacing it with a larger, less polar group can decrease QED.
- **Introduce a long alkyl chain**: Adding a long alkyl chain can decrease solubility and increase molecular weight.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the reasoning, the top suggestion to decrease QED while maintaining similarity to the input molecule is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the sulfonamide group with a less polar group like a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce modifications that reduce the drug-likeness. Drug-likeness is often reduced by adding bulky groups, introducing polar moieties, or disrupting planarity. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify Key Features of the Root Molecule**: The root molecule contains an ether group (C-O-C), an aromatic ring, an amide group (NC=O), and a chiral center. These features contribute to its drug-likeness.

2. **Strategies to Reduce QED**: Modifications that increase molecular weight, introduce polarity, or reduce flexibility can decrease QED. Examples include adding large or polar groups, removing hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, or introducing steric hindrance.

3. **Maintaining Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure but should focus on peripheral changes to retain similarity.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Add a large, polar group to the aromatic ring**: Introducing a polar functional group like a sulfonamide or a nitro group to the aromatic ring can increase polarity and steric hindrance, reducing QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the aromatic ring at the para position relative to the ether group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule **less drug-like** and **decreasing the QED by at least 0.1**, while maintaining similarity to the input molecule, we need to consider modifications that reduce favorable drug-like properties. The QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and lipophilicity. Therefore, we can focus on changes like:

1. **Reducing hydrogen bond acceptors**: Removing or replacing polar groups (e.g., carbonyl or hydroxyl) can decrease QED.
2. **Increasing molecular weight**: Adding bulky groups can reduce drug-likeness and lower QED.
3. **Introducing less favorable properties**: Adding hydrophobic groups or less polar functional groups can reduce QED.

Given the structure of the root molecule, we can target specific functional groups for modification. For example:
- The carbonyl group (C=O) in the amide linkage can be replaced with a less polar group.
- The hydroxyl group on the benzene ring can be substituted with a bulkier or less polar group.
- The bromine atom can be replaced with a larger halogen or a hydrophobic group.

Here’s the reasoning for the top-1 suggestion:
- Replace the **hydroxyl group** on the benzene ring with a **methyl group**. This will reduce hydrogen bonding capability and increase hydrophobicity, which should lower QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring with a methyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of decreasing the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-like properties. 

### Reasoning Process:
1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: QED is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. For example, adding large hydrophobic groups, increasing molecular weight, or reducing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors can help.

2. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity. 

3. **Modification Suggestions**:
   - **Add a bulky hydrophobic group**: This can increase molecular weight and logP, reducing QED.
   - **Remove a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor**: This can make the molecule less drug-like.
   - **Replace a polar group with a non-polar group**: This can reduce the polar surface area and hydrogen bonding potential.
   - **Introduce a cyclopropyl group**: This can add steric hindrance and reduce drug-likeness.
   - **Replace an amide with an ester**: This can reduce hydrogen bonding potential.

4. **Action Space**: Based on the action space, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups.

5. **Final Suggestion**: Given the constraints, the most effective modification would be to **replace the amide group (-NHC=O) with a less polar functional group like an ester (-COO-)**, which reduces hydrogen bonding capacity and decreases QED.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NHC=O) with an ester group (COO) to decrease hydrogen bonding potential and reduce QED."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Objective:** The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **QED Considerations:** QED is influenced by molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that increase molecular weight, increase logP (make it more hydrophobic), or reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

3. **Similarity Considerations:** The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule. Therefore, changes should be made to peripheral groups rather than the central scaffold.

4. **Strategy:** To achieve the desired decrease in QED, we can:
   - Replace polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl, amine) with less polar or hydrophobic groups.
   - Introduce bulky, non-polar substituents that increase molecular weight and logP.

5. **Proposed Modification:** Replace the hydroxyl group with a less polar and more hydrophobic group, such as a methoxy group, which will reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors and increase logP.

**Final Suggestion:**
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the hydroxyl group with a methoxy group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

1. **Goal**: Modify the root molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity. The QED of the root molecule is 0.791, so the target QED after modification should be ≤ 0.691.

2. **Strategy**: To decrease QED, we need to introduce features that are less drug-like, such as:
   - Adding bulky or polar groups.
   - Introducing less common or more complex functional groups.
   - Reducing the number of hydrogen bond acceptors or donors.

3. **Considerations**:
   - The molecule should remain similar to the root molecule, so modifications should be focused on specific regions rather than the entire structure.
   - The modifications should not drastically alter the core scaffold.

4. **Potential Actions**:
   - Replace the carbonyl group with a less common functional group.
   - Add a bulky group to the aromatic ring or the piperazine ring.
   - Introduce a polar or charged group to decrease drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the above reasoning, the top suggestion to decrease QED while maintaining similarity is:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group with a sulfonamide group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less drug-like and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to focus on modifications that disrupt favorable drug-like properties. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify Key Features Affecting QED**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by properties like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. Decreasing QED typically involves making the molecule larger, more lipophilic, or introducing unfavorable functional groups.

2. **Modification Strategy**: To reduce QED, we can:
   - Add bulky or lipophilic groups to increase molecular weight and logP.
   - Introduce polar or charged groups that disrupt hydrogen bonding or increase polar surface area.
   - Remove or replace functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness.

3. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.

4. **Avoid Repeating Previous Suggestions**: Ensure the suggested modification is unique and hasn’t been proposed before.

With these considerations, the top-1 suggestion is:

**Final Suggestion**: Replace the carbonyl group in the lactam ring with a sulfonyl group.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process

1. **Goal**: Modify the molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while keeping it structurally similar to the original molecule.
2. **Approach**: 
   - **QED Reduction**: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by factors like molecular weight, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups. To reduce QED, we can introduce less drug-like features, such as increasing molecular weight, adding polar groups, or introducing steric hindrance.
   - **Structural Similarity**: To maintain similarity, modifications should focus on functional groups or atoms that are not central to the core structure of the molecule.
3. **Potential Modifications**:
   - **Replace the ester group** with a larger, less drug-like group like a carboxylate.
   - **Add a hydroxyl group** to a non-central position to increase polarity.
   - **Introduce a bulky group** like a phenyl ring or a tertiary butyl group to increase steric hindrance.
4. **Previous Experience**: Based on previous suggestions, the modifications should avoid repeating previous changes and focus on new areas of the molecule.

### Final Suggestion
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the ester group with a carboxylate group on the carbonyl carbon attached to the nitrogen atom."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the given molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to modify the molecule in a way that reduces its drug-like properties. Here are some key considerations:

1. **QED Reduction**: QED is influenced by properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, the presence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and polar surface area. Modifications that increase molecular weight, hydrophobicity, or the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors can decrease QED.

2. **Structural Similarity**: To maintain similarity, modifications should be made to functional groups or atoms that do not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule.

3. **Avoiding Repeated Suggestions**: Ensure that the suggested modification is unique and not previously mentioned.

4. **Action Space**: Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group in a way that aligns with the above considerations.

### Suggested Modification:
To decrease the QED, we can **add a hydrophobic phenyl group to the nitrogen in the amide group**, which will increase the hydrophobicity and molecular weight, thereby reducing the QED. This modification maintains the core structure of the molecule while effectively reducing its drug-like properties.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a phenyl group to the nitrogen in the amide group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the given molecule significantly (by at least 0.1) while maintaining structural similarity, we need to make modifications that reduce drug-likeness. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **QED Reduction Strategy**: Drug-likeness is influenced by properties like molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, and polarity. To decrease QED, we can:
   - Increase hydrophobicity by adding non-polar groups.
   - Introduce steric hindrance or bulky groups that disrupt molecular planarity.
   - Reduce hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.

2. **Structural Similarity**: Ensure the modifications retain the core structure of the molecule, focusing on peripheral changes.

3. **Avoid Repeating Previous Suggestions**: Ensure the modifications are novel and not repetitive.

4. **Non-Abbreviated Suggestions**: Use full names of atoms or functional groups.

5. **Modification Instruction**: Provide clear, specific instructions for each suggestion.

**Reasoning**: One effective way to reduce QED is to replace a hydrogen bond acceptor (e.g., the carbonyl group) with a hydrophobic group. This would decrease polarity and disrupt drug-like properties.

**Final Suggestion**:

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the amide with a methyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that would reduce the drug-likeness of the molecule. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by several factors, including molecular weight, hydrophobicity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups. To decrease QED, we can introduce changes that increase hydrophobicity, reduce polarity, or add bulkier groups. Additionally, we should ensure that the modifications maintain some similarity to the original molecule.

**Reasoning Process:**

1. **Increase Hydrophobicity:** Introducing hydrophobic groups like phenyl rings or alkyl chains can decrease QED.
2. **Reduce Polarity:** Removing or replacing polar groups like amines or carbonyls with less polar groups can decrease QED.
3. **Add Bulky Groups:** Adding bulky groups can decrease QED by making the molecule less drug-like.
4. **Maintain Similarity:** The modifications should be conservative to ensure the new molecules remain similar to the original.

Based on these principles, the following modification is suggested:

**Final Suggestion:**

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the fluorine atoms on the aromatic ring with chlorine atoms to increase hydrophobicity and reduce QED."]
```

This modification is expected to decrease QED by increasing the hydrophobicity of the molecule while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, we need to consider modifications that disrupt the drug-like properties while maintaining structural similarity. Here’s the reasoning process:

1. **Identify Drug-Like Features**: The molecule has several drug-like features, such as the amide bond, aromatic rings, and chiral centers. To decrease QED, we can disrupt these features.

2. **Maintain Similarity**: We should avoid drastic changes to maintain structural similarity. Modifications should be localized to specific functional groups or atoms.

3. **Decrease QED**: To lower QED, we can:
   - Introduce less polar groups.
   - Remove or modify hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.
   - Increase molecular weight or hydrophobicity.

4. **Avoid Repeating Previous Suggestions**: Ensure that the suggested modifications are novel and not repeated from previous suggestions.

### Reasoning for the Modification:
One effective way to decrease QED is to replace the amide group with a less polar and less hydrogen-bonding group, such as an ester or ether. This change will reduce the molecule's overall polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, which are important factors in drug-likeness.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with an ester group to decrease polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity."]
```

This modification is expected to lower the QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: The goal is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule.

2. **QED Consideration**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.8209. To decrease it by at least 0.1, the modified molecule should have a QED of ≤ 0.7209.

3. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity. 

4. **Modification Strategy**: To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less desirable in drug-like molecules, such as:
   - Adding large, bulky groups that may reduce bioavailability.
   - Introducing polar or charged groups that may reduce membrane permeability.
   - Adding functional groups that increase molecular weight or logP unfavorably.

5. **Avoid Repetition**: Ensure that the suggested modification does not repeat previous suggestions.

### Suggested Modification:
One effective way to decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity is to **replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O))**. This modification introduces a bulkier and more polar functional group, which is likely to decrease the QED significantly while keeping the core structure intact.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (NC(=O)) with a sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)) in the molecule."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The task is to modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like by decreasing its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1, while keeping the molecule structurally similar to the original.

2. **QED Analysis**: The QED of the root molecule is currently 0.9056918114922455. We need to reduce this value by at least 0.1, bringing it below 0.8056918114922455.

3. **Strategy:** 
   - To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less favorable in drug-like molecules, such as large hydrophobic groups, polar but non-ionizable groups, or groups that increase molecular weight significantly.
   - We want to ensure that the modifications do not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity.
   - Replace or add functional groups that are less common in drugs, such as bulky or highly polar groups.

4. **Potential Modifications:**
   - Replace the acetyl group (C(C)=O) with a larger, less polar group like a tert-butyl group.
   - Replace the amide group (C(=O)N) with a less polar or bulkier group.
   - Replace the methoxy group (OCH3) with a larger ether or a non-polar group.
   - Add a bulky substituent to the aromatic ring to increase steric hindrance.
   - Replace the piperazine ring with a less drug-like, bulkier ring system.

5. **Final Choice**: 
   - Replace the acetyl group (C(C)=O) with a tert-butyl group. This modification increases the hydrophobicity and molecular weight, which are both factors that tend to decrease QED.

**final_suggestion**:
["Replace the acetyl group at the end of the piperazine ring with a tert-butyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the intent of the question, we need to modify the root molecule in a way that reduces its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity to the original molecule. The Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding bulky groups, or reducing hydrogen bonding potential.

**Reasoning Process:**
1. **Increase Hydrophobicity**: Adding hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains) can decrease QED by increasing logP.
2. **Add Bulky Groups**: Introducing sterically bulky groups can make the molecule less drug-like by reducing its ability to interact with biological targets.
3. **Reduce Hydrogen Bonding**: Removing or replacing hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (e.g., hydroxyl groups, amines) can decrease QED.
4. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should retain the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity.

**Suggested Action:**
Replace the carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule with a more hydrophobic and bulky group, such as a tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3). This modification will increase the hydrophobicity and steric hindrance, thereby decreasing the QED.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carbonyl group in the molecule with a tert-butyl group to increase hydrophobicity and steric hindrance."]

AI Suggestion 0: To achieve the goal of making the molecule less like a drug and decreasing its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule, we need to consider modifications that reduce drug-likeness. This can be achieved by introducing or altering functional groups that are less common in drugs, such as bulky or polar groups, or by reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

### Reasoning Process:
1. **Reduce Drug-Likeness**: To make the molecule less like a drug, we can introduce functional groups that are less common in pharmaceuticals, such as nitro groups, sulfonates, or large hydrophobic groups.
2. **Decrease QED**: QED is influenced by molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. Introducing bulky or polar groups can decrease QED.
3. **Maintain Similarity**: The modifications should not drastically alter the core structure of the molecule to maintain similarity to the original molecule.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Add a Nitro Group**: Adding a nitro group to the aromatic ring can reduce drug-likeness and decrease QED due to increased polarity and molecular weight.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a nitro group to the aromatic ring (c1) of the molecule."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** The task is to modify the given molecule (`Cc1ccccc1C1=C[C@@H]([C@H]2NC(c3ccccc3C)=NO2)N=N1`) to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining structural similarity.

2. **QED Analysis:** The QED of the root molecule is 0.9358, and the threshold requires a decrease to below 0.8358. QED is influenced by factors such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less drug-like, such as increasing hydrophobicity, adding bulky groups, or altering hydrogen bonding.

3. **Structural Similarity:** The modifications should not drastically change the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity to the input molecule.

4. **Potential Modifications:**
   - **Add a hydrophobic group:** Adding a hydrophobic group like a long alkyl chain can increase logP and make the molecule less drug-like.
   - **Replace a polar group with a nonpolar group:** For example, replacing the hydroxyl group with a methyl group can reduce hydrogen bonding potential.
   - **Add a bulky group:** Introducing a bulky group like a tert-butyl group can decrease QED.
   - **Introduce a less common functional group:** For instance, adding a nitro group can decrease drug-likeness.
   - **Remove a polar group:** Removing a polar group like the hydroxyl group can reduce hydrogen bonding potential.

5. **Final Suggestion:** Based on the above analysis, the most effective modification to decrease QED while maintaining similarity is to **add a bulky hydrophobic group** to the molecule.

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to modify functional groups or atoms in a way that reduces drug-like properties. Here’s how we can approach this:

### Reasoning Process:
1. **QED Reduction**: QED considers factors like molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can:
   - Increase molecular weight or logP.
   - Reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.
   - Add hydrophobic groups or remove polar groups.

2. **Structural Similarity**: To maintain similarity, we should avoid drastic changes (e.g., adding or removing large rings) and focus on small, localized modifications.

3. **Suggested Modifications**:
   - Replace the amide group (`C(=O)N`) with a less polar group (e.g., methylene group).
   - Remove the carboxylate group (`C(=O)[O-]`) and replace it with a non-polar group.
   - Add a hydrophobic group (e.g., methyl group) to the molecule to increase logP.
   - Replace the tertiary amine (`[NH+]`) with a neutral or less polar group (e.g., methylene).
   - Introduce a bulkier group to disrupt hydrogen bonding.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the above reasoning, the most effective suggestion is to **replace the carboxylate group (`C(=O)[O-]`) with a methyl group**. This modification reduces polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, thereby decreasing QED significantly while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the carboxylate group with a methyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while keeping it structurally similar, we need to make modifications that reduce drug-like properties. Drug-like molecules typically have balanced hydrophobicity, appropriate molecular weight, and specific functional groups. To decrease QED, we can introduce modifications that disrupt these characteristics, such as adding polar groups, increasing molecular weight, or introducing undesirable functional groups.

Here’s the reasoning process:
1. **Introduce Polar Groups**: Adding highly polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups) can decrease QED by increasing hydrophilicity and disrupting the balance of the molecule.
2. **Increase Molecular Weight**: Adding bulky substituents can increase molecular weight, which generally decreases QED.
3. **Introduce Undesirable Functional Groups**: Groups like nitro or sulfonamides can decrease QED due to their poor drug-like properties.

Based on these principles, the top suggestion is to **add a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring**, which increases polarity and disrupts the molecule's drug-like properties while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Add a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring attached to the carbonyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:
1. **Objective**: Modify the root molecule to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Current QED**: The QED of the root molecule is 0.886, so we need to reduce it to below 0.786.
3. **Approach**:
   - **Decrease Drug-likeness**: Remove or modify functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness, such as amides, amines, or aromatic rings.
   - **Maintain Similarity**: Ensure the modifications are minimal to keep the structure similar to the root molecule.
4. **Possible Modifications**:
   - Replace the amide group (`O=C(NCc1ccco1)`) with a less polar group, such as an ester or ether.
   - Remove or replace the piperidine ring (`C1CCN(c2cnc(N3CCCC3)nc2)CC1`) with a simpler, non-cyclic structure.
   - Replace the aromatic ring (`c1ccco1`) with a non-aromatic ring or chain.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (O=C(NCc1ccco1)) with an ester group (O=C(OCCc1ccco1))."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, the following reasoning and strategies can be applied:

### Reasoning Process:
1. **QED Reduction**: The Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) is influenced by molecular properties such as molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can introduce features that deviate from typical drug-like properties, such as increasing molecular weight, adding hydrophobic groups, or introducing steric hindrance.
  
2. **Structural Similarity**: The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule to ensure similarity. This can be achieved by making small, localized changes, such as modifying side chains or functional groups.

3. **Action Space**: Based on the action space, we can add, delete, or replace atoms or functional groups. The goal is to make targeted modifications that decrease QED without drastically altering the molecule.

4. **Previous Experience**: Since we need to avoid repeating previous suggestions, we should focus on new modifications that haven't been tried before while ensuring they meet the QED reduction threshold.

5. **Example Modification**: Adding a bulky, hydrophobic group like a phenyl ring or replacing a polar group with a non-polar one can decrease QED effectively.

### Suggested Modification:
- **Replace the methoxy group (OC) on the phenyl ring with a non-polar tert-butyl group.**

This modification introduces a bulky, non-polar group, which is likely to decrease QED by increasing hydrophobicity and molecular weight while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the methoxy group on the phenyl ring with a tert-butyl group."]
```

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

To decrease the QED of the root molecule by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity, we need to introduce modifications that make the molecule less drug-like. QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is influenced by molecular weight, logP, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, polar surface area, and the presence of certain functional groups. To decrease QED, we can:

1. **Add bulky or hydrophobic groups**: Increasing molecular weight or logP can reduce QED.
2. **Modify hydrogen bond donors/acceptors**: Reducing the number of these groups can decrease QED.
3. **Introduce polar or charged groups**: These can disrupt drug-likeness by increasing polar surface area or introducing undesired interactions.
4. **Remove or replace functional groups that contribute to drug-likeness**: For example, replacing an amide group with a less drug-like group.

Given the structure of the root molecule, we can focus on modifying the **secondary amine** in the piperazine ring (N1CCN) or the **amide group** (C(=O)NCc2cccc3ccccc23) to reduce QED. One effective strategy is to **replace the amide group with a less polar or bulkier group**, which can decrease QED while maintaining structural similarity.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group (C(=O)NCc2cccc3ccccc23) with a bulkier ester group (C(=O)OCc2cccc3ccccc23)."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** Modify the root molecule to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while maintaining structural similarity.
2. **Current QED:** 0.8997, so the target QED after modification should be ≤ 0.7997.
3. **Strategy:** To decrease QED, we can introduce features that are less drug-like, such as:
   - Adding bulky or non-polar groups that reduce solubility or permeability.
   - Reducing the number of hydrogen bond donors or acceptors.
   - Introducing steric hindrance or non-aromatic rings.
4. **Similarity:** The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule, including the nitrile group, the fused ring system, and the amide linkage.
5. **Action Space:** Add, delete, or replace an atom or functional group.

**Top Suggestion:**

To decrease the QED, we can **replace the nitrile group with a bulky alkyl group**, such as an isopropyl group. This change reduces the polarity and introduces steric hindrance, making the molecule less drug-like while maintaining structural similarity.

```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the nitrile group with an isopropyl group."]

AI Suggestion 0: **Reasoning Process:**

1. **Goal:** Modify the root molecule to decrease its QED by at least 0.1 while ensuring the output molecules remain structurally similar to the input molecule.
2. **QED Considerations:** QED is influenced by factors like molecular weight, logP, the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and polar surface area. To decrease QED, we can introduce features that make the molecule less drug-like, such as increasing molecular weight, altering logP, or adding polar groups.
3. **Structural Similarity:** The modifications should preserve the core structure of the molecule, ensuring it remains similar to the original.
4. **Action Space:** Based on the given action space (add, delete, replace an atom or functional group), we will focus on substitutions or additions that decrease QED without drastically altering the core structure.
5. **Specific Modification:** A straightforward way to decrease QED is to add a polar or bulky group, such as a hydroxyl or nitro group, which can increase molecular complexity and decrease drug-likeness.

**Final Suggestion:**

Replace the amide nitrogen in the cyclic amine ring with a hydroxyl group to increase polarity and decrease QED.

AI Suggestion 0: Let’s carefully analyze the task and reasoning process:

### Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. **Goal**: Modify the root molecule (`CC(C)[C@H](Nc1cc(C#N)ccn1)C(=O)[O-]`) to make it less drug-like and decrease its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) by at least 0.1. The QED of the root molecule is **0.776**, so the target QED should be **≤ 0.676**.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The modified molecule should remain structurally similar to the root molecule.
   - The modifications should not repeat suggestions from previous prompts.
   - The suggestion should be specific and avoid abbreviations.
3. **Strategy**:
   - To reduce QED, focus on introducing features that decrease drug-likeness, such as adding bulky groups, reducing polarity, or introducing non-drug-like functional groups.
   - Prioritize modifications that maintain structural similarity, such as altering side chains or functional groups connected to the core structure.

### Suggested Modifications:
1. **Introduce a bulky, non-polar group**: Replace the nitrile group (`C#N`) with a tert-butyl group to reduce polarity and increase steric hindrance, decreasing drug-likeness.
2. **Reduce polar interactions**: Replace the carboxylate group (`C(=O)[O-]`) with a non-polar methyl group to decrease polarity and QED.
3. **Introduce a less favorable functional group**: Replace the amine group (`NH`) with a nitro group, which is less common in drug-like molecules and reduces QED.
4. **Add a hydrophobic chain**: Append a long alkyl chain (e.g., hexyl group) to the aromatic ring to increase hydrophobicity and decrease QED.
5. **Replace the aromatic nitrogen**: Replace the nitrogen in the pyridine ring with a carbon to reduce hydrogen bonding potential and lower QED.

### Final Suggestion:
Based on the analysis, the most effective and structurally conservative modification is introducing a bulky, non-polar group to replace the nitrile group, as it directly reduces polarity and increases steric hindrance while maintaining structural similarity.

```python

AI Suggestion 0: ### Reasoning Process:

The goal is to modify the root molecule (`Cc1cc(NC(=O)CCc2cccc(Cl)c2Cl)no1`) to make it less like a drug and decrease its QED by at least 0.1, while maintaining similarity to the original molecule. The current QED of the root molecule is 0.9322565159146183, so the target QED after modification should be less than 0.8322565159146183.

To achieve this, we need to introduce changes that generally reduce drug-likeness, such as:

1. **Adding bulkier groups**: Bulky groups like aromatic rings or long aliphatic chains can decrease QED by increasing molecular weight and reducing solubility.
2. **Removing hydrogen bond donors or acceptors**: Removing groups like amides or amines can reduce QED by decreasing the number of hydrogen bond interactions.
3. **Introducing hydrophobic groups**: Adding hydrophobic groups like alkyl chains or aromatic rings can decrease QED by reducing solubility.
4. **Decreasing solubility or increasing rigidity**: Introducing rigid structures or groups that reduce solubility can lower QED.

Given the structure of the root molecule, we can target the amide group (`NC(=O)`), the aromatic rings, or the chlorine atoms for modification. Since the molecule already contains aromatic rings and chlorine atoms, we can focus on the amide group or introduce additional hydrophobic groups.

### Final Suggestion:
```python
final_suggestion = ["Replace the amide group with a long aliphatic chain to increase hydrophobicity and decrease QED."]
```

This suggestion avoids repeating previous modifications, maintains similarity to the original molecule, and introduces a change that is likely to significantly decrease QED.

'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "\n    $root_question: Can you make root_molecule = C[C@H]1C(=O)N2CCCc3cc(NC(=O)C(=O)NCC[C@@H](O)C(C)(C)C)cc1c32 less soluble in water and more hydrogen bond donors and increase logP by at least 0.5. increase HBD by at least 1. ? The output molecules should be similar to the input molecule. You are suggested to edit root_molecule according to the suggestion:  Give me five new molecules different from root_molecule in SMILES only and list them using bullet points. No explanation is needed. \n\n    $root_property: The logP of root molecule is: 1.9347. The HBD of root molecule is: 3. \n\n    $threshold: You should optimize the logP increase more than the amount of 0.5. You should optimize the HBD increase more than the amount of 1. \n\n    \n    Consider the $root_prompt, $root_property, $threshold. Your task is to suggest possible actions that could achieve the intent of the $root_question.\n\n    $search_state: current_best_mol in the message\n\n    $action_space: Add, delete, replace an atom or functional group.\n\n    Your answers should use the following guidelines:\n0) 1. You should give a python list named final_suggestion which contains top-1 suggestion based on the previous information.\n2. You should learn from the previous experience, especially the substructure change of molecules.\n3. Your suggestion should not repeat the previous suggestion in $previous prompt.\n4. In your suggestion, Please do not show any abbreviation of a atom or functional group. For example, when you need to show 'hydroxyl group', do not show '(OH)' in your suggestion!\n5. Each of your suggestion should be a sentence of modification instruction rather than a SMILES string.\n\n1) 6. Please note that your suggestion should also consider the similarity before and after modification.\n\n\n    Take a deep breath and let's think about the goal and guidelines step-by-step\nRemember, you should give your reasoning process first and finally return a python list named final_suggestion!\n"}]

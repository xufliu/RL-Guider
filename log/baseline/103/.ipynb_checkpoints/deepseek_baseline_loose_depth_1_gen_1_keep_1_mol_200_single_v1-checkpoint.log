AI answer 0: To enhance the drug-likeness and QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) of the molecule while keeping it structurally similar to the original, we can introduce modifications that improve properties such as solubility, bioavailability, and metabolic stability. Here are five modified molecules:
